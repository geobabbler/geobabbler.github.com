    <id>http://blog.geomusings.com/2013/10/07/maryland-department-of-planning-bundles-property-data-with-qgis</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This past week, I got an e-mail from Jim Cannistra, Director of Data Planning Services and the <a href="http://www.mdp.state.md.us/home.shtml">Maryland Department of Planning</a> (MDP), alerting me to a new product available from MDP called <a href="http://www.mdp.state.md.us/OurProducts/PropertyMapProducts/FINDERProduct.shtml">FINDER Quantum</a>. This product bundles Maryland property data and related products with <a href="http://qgis.org">QGIS</a> software to provide users with a fully-functional, free-standing system for interacting with the data. It is designed to replace an older, custom software product, capitalizing on an industry-standard open-source system.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>From the MDP site, the bundled data includes:</p>

<blockquote cite="http://www.mdp.state.md.us/OurProducts/PropertyMapProducts/FINDERProduct.shtml">The product DVD includes the State&#8217;s computerized property (tax) maps; the x,y linkages (point or polygon) to the Parcel, Computer Assisted Mass Appraisal (CAMA) and Sale datasets; Parcel, CAMA and Sale data, including Sale data via download from the Subscriber Website, from the Maryland State Department of Assessments and Taxation (SDAT); reference grids including a grid for the property (tax) maps, an ADC map book grid, a grid for the Maryland State Highway Administration (SHA) road, stream and feature maps and a grid for USGS 7.5&#8217; Topographical quad maps; and additional SHA files including a digital centerline roads file, data derived from SHA digital grid maps, an SHA major roads file and a county boundary file.<br/>
<br/>
Also included are land use/land cover data; congressional and legislative district boundary files; census geography and census demographic data; ZIP code boundary files; Priority Funding Area (PFA) designations; floodplain data, including DFIRM data for selected jurisdictions; protected lands boundaries; watershed data; generalized zoning designations; sewer service area boundaries; public water service area boundaries for selected jurisdictions; National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) Maryland coverage; residential Sales x,y point and summary files derived from SDAT Parcel and Sale data; large-scale, high resolution color digital-ortho imagery and a custom Quantum GIS project file (.qgs).</blockquote>


<p>The MDP site indicates there is a <a href="http://www.mdp.state.md.us/pdf/OurProducts/PropertyMapProducts/Finder/CstFnd.pdf">licensing fee</a> (PDF), which I assume is to cover the management of the data sets and the <a href="http://www.mdp.state.md.us/pdf/OurProducts/PropertyMapProducts/Finder/LicFnd.pdf">license agreement</a>, while acknowledging the GPL license of QGIS itself, seems to place the actual FINDER extension itself outide of any open-source license. (I am not a lawyer so I&#8217;ll accept guidance on that interpretation.) That said, bundling QGIS with data that the statewide user community values and an application to help exploit it is a great way to get more users on board with QGIS.</p>

<p>To that end, users that choose to take advantage of FINDER Quantum will want to keep in mind that great <a href="http://www.esrgc.org/training/">QGIS-related resources</a> are available via <a href="http://www.salisbury.edu/geography/">Salisbury State University</a> and that training is also available from <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=14036437">Randal Hale</a> of <a href="http://www.northrivergeographic.com/introduction-to-quantum-gis">North River Geographics</a>. Once you have this powerful application installed, you can start to tap into a <a href="http://boundlessgeo.com/solutions/solutions-software/quantum-gis/">deep pool</a> of <a href="http://www.osgeo.org/search_profile">resources</a> to build your expertise.</p>

<p>So kudos to MDP for bundling their data with a powerful mapping, visualization, and analysis tool in QGIS. I hope that, in the near future, MDP considers making the FINDER application itself open-source but this is a great first step.</p>

    <link href="http://blog.geomusings.com/2013/09/20/come-sling-code-with-us/"/>
    <updated>2013-09-20T09:57:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.geomusings.com/2013/09/20/come-sling-code-with-us</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s been a pretty good week for us at <a href="http://www.zekiah.com">Zekiah</a>. We announced two new <a href="http://www.zekiah.com/index.php?q=press/2013/09/16/zekiah-technologies-inc-wins-marine-corps-logistics-support-services-mclogss-contra">contract</a> <a href="http://www.zekiah.com/index.php?q=press/2013/09/16/zekiah-technologies-inc-awarded-contract-mission-assurance-division">wins</a> and I&#8217;m pleased to say that we&#8217;re not done yet. After final paperwork is done, we should be able to announce a couple more. These are the things that make small-business ownership worthwhile: doing good work, building relationships with our customers and then leveraging our track record to be able to work with new customers. Project execution and business development help us build the foundation necessary to be a good place for our employees to work and we try hard every day to make sure that we are such a place.</p>

<p>The second contract win we announced this week, with the US Navy&#8217;s Mission Assurance Division in Dahlgren, Virginia, is particularly fulfilling for us because we have worked side-by-side with that organization since the late 1990&#8217;s, doing challenging work in the areas of infrastructure protection and situational awareness during that time. We have literally grown and evolved alongside them over that time.</p>

<p>I typically try not to mix my blog with the daily operational aspects of my work at Zekiah. Usually, my work comes through in abstracted form in various posts, although many posts actually reflect my own personal experimentation and side projects. I&#8217;m stepping outside of that practice today to say that our latest contract win has given us <a href="http://www.zekiah.com/index.php?q=careers/openings/gis-software-developer-ii">an opening for a software developer</a> to come work with us at the Mission Assurance Division.</p>

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://blog.geomusings.com/images/posts/desk.jpg" /><div style="text-align: center;font-size: 14px;">Can you bring this workstation to life?</div></div>


<br />




<!--more-->


<p>This is an immediate opening and you would be performing .Net development with the full range of Microsoft and Esri technologies. The work has been challenging and is mission-essential for not only our customer but their sponsors as well. The work would require you to be on-site full time but you would be working with one of the most talented teams of developers, both government and contractor, with which I have ever been associated. This is a group from which I have learned a great deal and still do. This specific position is not for someone who is particularly senior but it is also not entry-level either. It&#8217;s a great opportunity to grow a career that&#8217;s underway and picking up steam.</p>

<p>You can get some details by checking out the <a href="http://www.zekiah.com/index.php?q=careers/openings/gis-software-developer-ii">offical job posting</a>, where you can also apply online. Most of that language is pulled directly from the description in the contract. If you want to get an idea of what the day-to-day work looks like, <a href="http://blog.geomusings.com/about/">you can always contact me directly</a>. I will draw your attention to one requirement, however: &#8220;Active security clearance or the ability to obtain a security clearance.&#8221; What that means is that we can&#8217;t entertain staffing via offshoring, nor can we consider applicants who do not hold US citizenship. I bring that up only because everyone&#8217;s time is valuable and I&#8217;d hate for you to waste your time applying if we can&#8217;t consider you.</p>

<p>So, if you&#8217;re looking for the next challenge in your career and want to work with a great team, please send us your vitals. Some of the best and most meaningful work I&#8217;ve done in my career was done supporting this customer.</p>

    <link href="http://blog.geomusings.com/2013/09/12/another-look-at-gis-stackexchange/"/>
    <updated>2013-09-12T11:10:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.geomusings.com/2013/09/12/another-look-at-gis-stackexchange</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A year ago, I used the StackExchange API to facilitate an <a href="http://blog.geomusings.com/2012/09/13/carving-up-gis-stackexchange/">analysis of tags on GIS StackExchange</a> to see what people were talking about on one of the largest and most successful vendor-neutral discussion sites in our industry. In that post, I stated &#8220;It would probably be good to revisit this in a year to see how things have changed, if at all.&#8221;</p>

<p>Well, a year has passed so I decided to do it again. I used the same scripts and approach I used last time in order to be consistent. Since this is one year later, there is one key caveat. My analysis last year looked at the top 100 tags since the start of the <a href="http://gis.stackexchange.com/">GIS StackExchange</a> site. Since I ran the same query this year, the new results are compounded so what they so are last year&#8217;s results plus activity since then. Essentially, you are looking at &#8220;that plus this.&#8221; The pie chart below shows the breakdown.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://blog.geomusings.com/images/posts/stackexchange_chart_2013.png" /></p>

<!--more-->


<p>Compared to last year&#8217;s results, there hasn&#8217;t been much movement in the distribution of tags. One thing I did notice, however is that the tag &#8220;qgis&#8221; leaped to the top of the list. Last year, &#8220;arcgis&#8221; was the top tag and &#8220;qgis&#8221; was number three. That said, I wouldn&#8217;t jump to too many conclusions. A quick <a href="http://blog.geomusings.com/assets/data/stack2013/output_2013.csv">look at the data</a> shows that, in addition to &#8220;arcgis&#8221;, there are version-specific tags such as &#8220;arcgis-10.0&#8221; and &#8220;arcgis-10.1&#8221; as well as product-specific tags like &#8220;arcgis-server&#8221; so there&#8217;s a lot of Esri-centric discussion going on, but that is to be expected. The top ten tags, however, include major components of the <a href="http://opengeo.org/">OpenGeo</a> Suite (OpenLayers, GeoServer, PostGIS) in addition to QGIS so open-source tools seem to be every bit as active a topic of discussion as do <a href="http://www.esri.com">Esri</a> tools.</p>

<p>Speaking of the top ten tags, they were: <br /><br />
1. qgis (3910) <br />
2. arcgis (2382) <br />
3. python (2171) <br />
4. arcgis-10.0 (2142) <br />
5. openlayers (1996) <br />
6. postgis (1560) <br />
7. geoserver (1193) <br />
8. arcobjects (1184) <br />
9. raster (1174) <br />
10. arcmap (1113) <br /></p>

<p>Last year, I got some back-channel requests to do a little more with the raw data so, seeing a chance to play with <a href="http://d3js.org">D3</a>, here is a look at how things break down. Hover over a bubble to see the full name and tag count. If you follow your nose a bit, the color scheme will become apparent in relation to the pie chart&#8217;s key.</p>

<iframe src="http://blog.geomusings.com/assets/data/stack2013/frame.html" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe>


<p>All of the same limitations I pointed out last year about posts having multiple tags and dilution across related tags still apply this year. If there is any insight into the mind share of the GIS community to be derived from this exercise, it is probably in the aggregate.</p>

<p>The exact StackExchange API URL that generated these results is: <a href="https://api.stackexchange.com/2.1/tags?order=desc&amp;sort=popular&amp;site=gis&amp;pagesize=100">https://api.stackexchange.com/2.1/tags?order=desc&amp;sort=popular&amp;site=gis&amp;pagesize=100</a></p>

<p>The results were generated on 11 September 2013 and subsequent results will vary from those shown here. The Python script used to process the results into CSV <a href="http://blog.geomusings.com/assets/data/stack2013/handle_json.zip">can be found here</a>.</p>

    <id>http://blog.geomusings.com/2013/09/10/random-geospatial-grab-bag</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s been a while since I&#8217;ve posted as the usual wind-down of summer and wind-up of the school year has had me otherwise engaged. What follows are few developments over the past few months that have floated through the transom of my geo-awareness.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://daylightdonutsstier.com/assets/images/slideshow/CakeDonuts.jpg" height="50%" width="50%"/></p>

<p><a href="http://geojson.io/">geojson.io</a> - Remember all of the attention given to the ability to render GitHub-hosted GeoJSON files as maps? Well, <a href="http://twitter.com/tmcw">Tom MacWright</a> of <a href="http://mapbox.com">MapBox</a> has, in fairly rapid fashion, given us this tool to edit GeoJSON in the browser and publish to either a GitHub repo or a gist. It&#8217;s an easy-to-use tool with an interface consistent with other MapBox tools. It&#8217;s definitely worth checking out and adds an important piece of workflow to the GeoJSON-on-GitHub concept.</p>

<!--more-->


<p><a href="http://gitspatial.com/">GitSpatial</a> - Continuing with the theme of being more productive with GeoJSON on GitHub, <a href="http://twitter.com/JCSanford">Jason Sanford</a> has developed GitSpatial to wrap a spatial API around your hosted GeoJSON. It actually works using a &#8216;sync&#8217; approach so it pulls the GeoJSON into its own infrastructure and watchs the data on GitHub for changes. Jason has also updated his <a href="http://geojason.info/leaflet-vector-layers/">Leaflet Vector Layers</a> project to support GitSpatial. This project is in its early stages and Jason has been very open to feedback. I encourage you to check it out and help him make it better.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gaia-gis.it/fossil/virtualpg/index">VirtualPG</a> - This extension to SQLite/SpatiaLite was released in August and it is intended to facilitate data exchange between those platforms and PostgreSQL/PostGIS. I have yet to kick the tires on it but I plan to soon.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.dhs.gov/infrastructure-information-partnerships#2">HSIP 2013</a> - For the first time in quite a while, I attended a <a href="https://www.hifldwg.org/">HIFLD</a> meeting. The theme of the meeting was HSIP Feedback, to which about one HIFLD per year is dedicated. While HSIP has never been perfect, it has managed to evolve to provide value across numerous communities. The meeting featured a parade of users articulating the essential nature of HSIP to their missions. With HSIP 2013, the distribution expands to 6 DVDs. In my opinion, this distribution method is one of its biggest, and most solvable, problems. With a plethora of <a href="http://www.weogeo.com">technologies</a> to choose from, streamlining and tailoring the delivery of HSIP to its users should be low-hanging fruit for HSIP&#8217;s custodians.</p>

<p>As for me, I&#8217;ve been spending my days writing interfaces for custom message formats to synchronize locations with video frames. It&#8217;s much lower-level development than I&#8217;ve done in a while but it&#8217;s been very fun. I&#8217;ve also been making some updates to my <a href="https://github.com/geobabbler/AGSOpenFormats">GeoJSON extension for ArcGIS Server</a> but I&#8217;ll post about that in more detail soon.</p>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[Why Do I Blog?]]></title>
    <link href="http://blog.geomusings.com/2013/08/12/why-do-i-blog/"/>
    <updated>2013-08-12T12:00:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.geomusings.com/2013/08/12/why-do-i-blog</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>TL;DR:</h2>

<p>In which, as a result of a <a href="http://blog.entchev.com/2013/08/08/gis-blogging-in-decline.aspx">post by Atanas Entchev</a>, I postulate on why I continue to do this blog thing. This is a departure from my typical subject matter and you can be forgiven for not reading any further.</p>

<hr />

<p>My friend <a href="http://twitter.com/atanas">Atanas Entchev&#8217;s</a> <a href="http://blog.entchev.com/2013/08/08/gis-blogging-in-decline.aspx">latest post</a> on a possible decline in GIS blogging got me looking at my own output. After and initial surge, I have held steady at 40 to 45 posts per year. The discussion around Atanas&#8217; post, both in his blog comments and on his <a href="https://plus.google.com/110319601981109631300/posts/A3twyjrs8yL">Google+ stream</a>, got me thinking about why I continue to do this. So, at the risk of being accused of engaging in philosophical navel-gazing, here it goes.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://blog.geomusings.com/images/posts/posts.png" /></p>

<p>This blog was not my first attempt at blogging. I originally had an <a href="http://www.esri.com">ESRI</a>-development focused blog on Blogger in about 2004. I think I made four or five posts, let it languish for a bit, and then killed it off. The main reason for that is that I wasn&#8217;t really sure what I was trying to accomplish with a blog. I never even backed it up so whatever was there is lost to the ages.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>Fast-forward to 2006 when I was at a stage in my career where I was working at a fairly cloistered customer site, building a human resources management system&#8230;in VB.NET no less. It was the first time since the beginning of my career that I was away from the GIS industry and I wasn&#8217;t interested in letting my skills soften. Up until that point, I had been primarily an ESRI developer but I was now using evenings at home to do experimental stuff to keep current. My company machine had ArcMap on it but I wasn&#8217;t going to swing an SDE license at home so I started looking at <a href="http://www.postgis.org">PostGIS</a>. That&#8217;s when I ran across <a href="https://code.google.com/p/ziggis/">zigGIS</a> and used it to extend out of my ESRI comfort zone into the world of open-source GIS.</p>

<p>All of that lead me to start blogging. Initially, I was doing web searches to find out how to do things I was trying to with ArcObjects and PostGIS. I would occasionally find a post that provided a good overview of a coding techniques or an in-depth discussion of how a piece of software behaved, but they were few and far between. That&#8217;s when I finally had a concept for a blog: to write the kind of blog that I was looking for and would want to read. So my early posts featured a lot of code snippets and such (this was in the pre- <a href="https://gist.github.com/">Gist</a> days when sites like <a href="http://sourceforge.net/">SourceForge</a>, <a href="https://code.google.com/">Google Code</a> and <a href="https://www.codeplex.com/">CodePlex</a> were overkill for snippets). It also generally tracked my growing personal explorations with open-source tools.</p>

<p>So that&#8217;s how I got into blogging but the title of this post is really looking for the reasons why I keep doing it. I&#8217;ll summarize:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>To give back - Over the years, the snippets have gotten more sporadic but I still try to post some outputs of my work from time to time. I can&#8217;t really devote the time to jump into an open-source project with both feet so my hope is that my blog can be an avenue to contribute back some of the knowledge I derive from my work.</p></li>
<li><p>To engage - I am a consultant after all. I am able to continue to ply my trade by being known and my blog is one component of building the track record of my work. Due to vagaries of Federal contracts, much of my work remains behind firewalls so my blog is a way to demonstrate some of what I can do outside the standard Federal procurement process. I would also be remiss if I didn&#8217;t acknowledge that my blog has been an avenue by which I have met a number of people that I now consider friends. For fear of leaving someone out, I won&#8217;t enumerate them here but the act of writing my blog, and reading others, has helped me connect with a lot of people I am glad to know.</p></li>
<li><p>To act as my own resource - I have often gone back to mine old posts to find a technique I implemented in the past and bring it forward to my current work. So, while my blog is out there for the public to see, it has become something of my own personal archive as well. It remains to be seen whether <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a> and Gist will put a dent in that use case.</p></li>
<li><p>To tidy up my own mind - It actually takes a lot of work to prepare a post, or at least it does for me. Oftentimes, I have a lot of &#8220;bit and pieces&#8221; floating around in my head and on various notepads and such. One of the attributes of working at multiple locations is that various pieces of related information can become scattered across separate e-mail systems, content management systems, notepads, post-its and the like. I can&#8217;t always have my smartphone with me or access my GMail, so some fragmentation can set in. Taking the time to write a post is an excellent way for me to pull together all of those disparate bits, organize them into a cohesive approach, and document that approach for others and for me (see item 3).</p></li>
<li><p>I am a writer - I used to write a lot of fiction and poetry. One day I may do so again. Until then, my blog scratches the itch for stringing some words together into something coherent.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>I remain committed to the idea of writing the kind of blog that I would want to read and I have tried to be consistent about that over the years. I am actually quite humbled that it seems to have found an audience, that anyone other than me reads it, and that others find value in it.</p>

<p>I can completely understand <a href="http://www.jonathancrowe.net/">Jonathan Crowe&#8217;s</a> decision to end his long-running, and excellent, blog <a href="http://www.maproomblog.com/2011/06/the_end.php">The Map Room</a>. Sometimes things just run their course. This much I can say: I won&#8217;t be ending mine in the near future. Late last year, I took the step of migrating my blog from Wordpress.com to a Jekyll/Octopress site hosted on GitHub pages. Extracting six years of content from Wordpress was no small task (thanks for the help, <a href="http://twitter.com/cageyjames">James</a>) so I did a gut check before moving forward. I decided that taking that step was a commitment to keep the blog going for the foreseeable future.</p>

<p>So back to Atanas&#8217; post: I do think GIS blogging, in the form it took when I started, is in decline. There were a lot of personal GIS blogs in 2006, many of which have fallen by the wayside. That&#8217;s probably true of blogs in general as social media platforms have eaten away at them. I don&#8217;t know that it&#8217;s a loss; I don&#8217;t know that it&#8217;s important at all. Human communication evolves over time. We just happen to be in a period where that process seems to be moving rapidly.</p>

<p>That said, some good individual blogs have popped up but I think blogging in general is becoming more polished and corporate. I think some of the better original content these days comes from multiple authors contributing to organizational blogs. In the geospatial industry, the <a href="http://www.mapbox.com/blog/">MapBox blog</a> stands out as this type of blog. Yes, the blog forwards the ends of MapBox but its content is genuinely useful to those trying to put MapBox to use. The same can be said of some of <a href="http://blogs.esri.com/esri/arcgis/">Esri&#8217;s blogs</a>, the content of which has shown marked improvement over the last 24 months or so.</p>

<p>Blogs can also help small companies establish their identity. At <a href="http://www.zekiah.com">my company</a>, we started a <a href="http://www.zekiah.com/index.php?q=blog">blog</a> a while back as a means to add fresh insights into our capabilities beyond the standard representation that most company web sites provide. Blogs are a nice long-form enhancement for organizations and I think they are safer because they minimize the risk misinterpretation that comes with a 140-character limit.</p>

<p>So that&#8217;s it. This is about as &#8220;meta&#8221; as I ever want to get on my blog. I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll do anything like this again because it smacks of philosophical navel-gazing. (I am usually my own harshest critic in that area.)  Thank you, as always, for stopping by.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>With the release of ArcGIS 10.2, <a href="http://www.esri.com">Esri</a> quietly added support for <a href="https://sqlite.org/">SQLite</a> as a geodatabase container. This is big news as the community has been looking for such support for some time. An open-source RDBMS originally designed for embedded systems, SQLite has a very small footprint and is <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/mostdeployed.html">arguably the most widely deployed RDBMS</a> in the world. (Thanks, in part, to the fact that it is embedded into Adobe Reader and other commonly used software.) Over the years numerous strategies for storing spatial data in SQLite have been developed, ranging from simply storing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-known_text">WKT or WKB</a> geometries in a column up to full extensions like <a href="http://www.gaia-gis.it/gaia-sins/">SpatiaLite</a>, which adds OGC-compliant data types and methods. SQLite is also the engine that drives the popular <a href="http://www.mapbox.com/developers/mbtiles/">MBTiles</a> implementation used by <a href="http://www.mapbox.com/tilemill/">TileMill</a> and <a href="http://www.mapbox.com">MapBox</a>.</p>

<!--more-->


<p><a href="http://resources.arcgis.com/en/help/main/10.2/index.html#//019v0000001w000000">According to the documentation</a>, ArcGIS supports the use of either Esri&#8217;s ST_GEOMETRY or SpatiaLite data types for geometry storage. This is consistent with Esri&#8217;s approach on other RDBMS platforms such as <a href="http://www.postgresql.org">PostgreSQL</a> and <a href="http://www.oracle.com">Oracle</a>. While SpatiaLite has been supported by platforms such as <a href="http://qgis.org/">QGIS</a>, I can&#8217;t say I&#8217;ve seen a huge demand for data in SpatiaLite format. I have been using it for a while in some of <a href="http://www.zekiah.com">my company&#8217;s</a> data modeling work as we have a Federal customer that has a documented requirement for generation of physical models in SpatiaLite, among other platforms. We have also taken the step of supporting SQLite as a container for our <a href="http://www.zekiah.com/index.php?q=blog/topics/pim">platform independent model (PIM) approach</a> for configuration management of logical geospatial data models.</p>

<p>Esri&#8217;s new support of SpatiaLite, combined with my existing customer requirements, obviously sparked my interest so I was curious to kick the tires. Unfortunately, I also had the situation that my development environment for the PIM tools, due to current customer constraints, must remain at ArcGIS 10.1 for both the desktop software and the underlying ArcObjects libraries. I have not been able to carve out the time to build a 10.2 VM.</p>

<p>Luckily, others were also interested in the new SpatiaLite support so <a href="http://twitter.com/brymcbride">Bryan McBride</a>, &#8221;<a href="http://twitter.com/fathersandman">Father Sandman</a>,&#8221; and I were able to crowdsource some very cursory compatibility tests via Twitter. The full tweet stream can be accessed by clicking the date in the tweet below.</p>

<div class='embed tweet'><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/billdollins">@billdollins</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/FatherSandman">@FatherSandman</a> Score! Looks like we&#39;ve confirmed ArcGIS 10.2, QGIS 1.9.0, and SpatiaLite-GUI 1.7.1 are compatible.</p>&mdash; Bryan McBride (@brymcbride) <a href="https://twitter.com/brymcbride/statuses/365103999671738369">August 7, 2013</a></blockquote>
<script async src="http://blog.geomusings.com//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>


<p>So, using Father Sandman&#8217;s existing 10.2 install, we were able to verify the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>A SpatiaLite database created in ArcGIS 10.2 can be accessed and viewed in QGIS 1.9.0 and SpatiaLite GUI 1.7.1</li>
<li>A SpatiaLite database created in QGIS 1.9.0 can be accessed in ArcGIS 10.2</li>
</ol>


<p>Obviously, some more rigorous tests need to be performed but the initial results are promising. I&#8217;m curious to explore the boundaries, in ArcGIS terms, between a SQLite geodatabase and a file geodatabase. It remains to be seen whether this will put a dent in the use of file geodatabases. If it happens at all, I think it will take time since SQLite is not on the radar of the vast majority of ArcGIS users. I would hope, at a minimum, it puts a final stake through the heart of the personal geodatabase. It could also drive explicit accreditation of SQLite/SpatiaLite tools on government systems, which would be nice.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m happy, and somewhat pleasantly surprised, to see Esri take this step and provide another open option for data exchange.</p>

<p>Now, about GeoJSON&#8230;</p>

    <updated>2013-07-28T10:54:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.geomusings.com/2013/07/28/devops-for-geospatial-data</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There has been a bit of buzz the past couple of weeks over the <a href="https://github.com/blog/1541-geojson-rendering-improvements">ability of GitHub to render GeoJSON and TopoJSON files</a> automatically using  and embedded <a href="http://leafletjs.com/">Leaflet</a> map and <a href="http://www.mapbox.com/">MapBox</a> technology. This buzz is quite justified as it presents an easy way to simply publish and visualize vector data sets. In the weeks since the initial announcement, the community has begun exploring the limits of GitHub&#8217;s capability. Probably the two biggest limiting factors are individual file size limits and API rate limits. Some, including myself, are exploring strategies for maximizing the ability to store, disseminate, and visualize data within these confines. For the near term, <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> will probably not be the place to store terabytes of data or act as the CDN for a high-volume mapping application. That is perfectly fine and there is still a great deal of value to be found within GitHub&#8217;s current generous constraints.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://blog.geomusings.com/images/posts/geodata-git.png" /></p>

<p>One aspect of GitHub (really, its underlying <a href="http://git-scm.com/">git</a> engine) that is of great interest to me is the ability to perform version control and configuration management on data itself. With GitHub, that currently takes the form of text-based formats such as JSON but it&#8217;s a start. In my experience supporting various customers over the years, configuration management of data has been a common gap in information operations. The most common, and inadequate, approach to this problem has been through the use of metadata. Almost two decades of viewing out-of-date, incomplete, and inaccurate metadata has given the lie to this approach. Metadata represents a separate maintenance workflow for which many organizations simply do not dedicate resources. Data-set-level metadata is also inadequate for volatile data sets in which individual records are updated frequently.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>I have worked with many organizations that had excellent DevOps processes for managing and deploying application code that simply had no corresponding processes for the data that the code was utilizing. We are long past time for addressing the importance of configuration management for data itself.</p>

<p>That is not to say there have not been approaches to addressing this issue. Since version 8.0, <a href="http://www.esri.com">Esri</a> has had a means of <a href="http://www.esri.com/software/arcgis/geodatabase/multi-user-functionality">versioning enterprise geodatabases</a> that are stored in an RDBMS. This approach does have the ability to track feature-level changes and manages their inclusion in the master version of the data set. Quite frankly, I&#8217;ve never loved the Esri approach to versioning. I think it gives too much responsibility to middleware when it should be the database&#8217;s sole responsibility to keep itself intact. Also, I have always felt the workflow is a bit too proscribed and takes too much business process decision ability from the data owner. That said, it has been the only real game in town for a long time so I have implemented it many times.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/">OpenStreetMap</a> (OSM) has also been a success story for tracking feature-level version history. Its approach has successfully managed millions of edits to a worldwide database so its utility is certainly proven. Organizations that need to maintain their own data behind their firewalls cannot really make use of OSM itself but the OSM approach is solid.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.zekiah.com">At my own company</a>, we have been working with customers to implement <a href="http://blog.geomusings.com/2012/03/27/configuration-management-for-geospatial-data-models/">configuration management of data models</a> (logical and physical) but we are not really addressing CM of the data managed by those models. Even so, working at the model/schema level has still helped our customers improve their data management workflows by being able to identify versions of data models supported by deployed applications and helping to migrate between versions as needed.</p>

<p>The recent move by GitHub to support visualization of spatial data files actually introduces no new capability in terms of configuration management of data files. Users have always had the ability to store and manage JSON, text, XML and other formats in GitHub and git. My hope is that the visualization capability, and the inevitable exploration it will generate, will shine more light on the issue of data configuration management. In my opinion, this is the most powerful aspect the platform brings.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m also encouraged by <a href="http://opengeo.org/">OpenGeo&#8217;s</a> <a href="https://github.com/opengeo/GeoGit">GeoGit</a> initiative. I have not personally experimented with it yet so I will not speculate on the specifics of its implementation, but I am happy to see OpenGeo recognizing the need for a more open approach to feature-level version control. Since, however, it will be open-source, my hope is that proprietary GIS vendors, or their supporting integrators, will eventually support it as well.</p>

<p>Ultimately, I am happy to see both GitHub and OpenGeo addressing this issue. Although their approaches are different, they offer, in addition to the Esri approach, choices for organizations in terms of workflow. Many data managers, whether for legal, strategic, or other reasons, recognize the importance of maintaining version history of geospatial data records. It is important for everything from parcel mapping to critical infrastructure protection and many other use cases. Historically, there have been very few tools available to address this problem effectively but I am hoping that is starting to change.</p>

    <updated>2013-07-19T00:02:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.geomusings.com/2013/07/19/focus</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>While the majority of the geospatial world was at the Esri International User Conference in San Diego last week, I was at a different conference in Orlando, Florida. This was my third time attending the Children with Diabetes (CWD) <a href="http://www.childrenwithdiabetes.com/activities/orlando2013/">Friends for Life</a> (FFL) conference and I&#8217;ll be there as often as I can for the foreseeable future. It&#8217;s beneficial in many obvious ways; enabling us to keep up with the latest developments in diabetes research and technologies as well as keeping us refreshed in terms of diabetes management best practices.</p>

<p>The unexpected thing for me over the years has been how the lessons I&#8217;ve learned at FFL have begun to translate into other aspects of life outside of diabetes. (I do not have diabetes myself but I am a parent of a person who does.)  This year, perhaps because the ongoing Esri UC was somewhere in the back of my mind, it provided a different lens through which to view my approach to my professional activities.</p>

<p>The content at FFL is varied. Some touches on leading edge work in the field of biological treatments such as the <a href="http://www.diabetesresearch.org/BioHub">Diabetes Research Institute&#8217;s BioHub</a> as well as mechanical/electronic treatments such as the <a href="http://artificialpancreasproject.com/">Artificial Pancreas Project</a>. Other content touches upon achieving more effective day-to-day management using current techniques such as insulin pumps, shots, carbohydrate counting and the like.</p>

<p>The conference includes many pharmaceutical companies offering competing products, differing lines of research that stand a chance of superseding one another, representatives of government agencies, insurance companies and advocacy groups that can have very adversarial relationships. Yet FFL has an overwhelmingly positive tone. This because everyone is focused on one goal: the elimination of diabetes. Any approach that represents a step toward that goal is cheered by all, as is any technique that eases the burden of living with diabetes in the meantime. Ultimately, the various technologies showcased at the conference help facilitate progress toward this goal but the technologies are not the point.</p>

<p>Let me say that again.</p>

<p><strong>The technologies are not the point.</strong></p>

<!--more-->


<p>This is the lesson that I am reminded of and am bringing back to my professional existence in the geospatial industry. Our industry has seen a lot of innovation from a number of players in recent years. The flowering of mature capability in the open-source world has, in my opinion, pushed proprietary vendors such as Esri offer improvements to their products and better solutions to their users. It can be easy to get caught up in the petty intrigues of the industry. What are Esri&#8217;s real motivations behind their latest acquisition? What mapping library is that government system using? Is that API really RESTful? And so on&#8230;</p>

<p>All of the geospatial tools in the marketplace, regardless of provenance, serve to facilitate solutions to a myriad of real-world problems. And those problems are the point. As a consultant in the geospatial industry, my job is to help my customers find the tools that best solve their problems and help implement them. My responsibility is to keep an open mind about all of the tools that are available.</p>

<div style="text-align: center;">
<iframe width="560" height="420" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/A8W8GGdD6pc?color=white&theme=light"></iframe>
(May be considered NSFW by some)
</div>


<br/>


<p>That doesn&#8217;t mean that I don&#8217;t have my preferences. I believe that open systems are better than closed. I believe that open-source licenses are inherently better at facilitating both enterprise scalability and grass-roots innovation. I believe that there&#8217;s a lot of really good proprietary, closed-source software. I believe that the greatest asset of any organization is its data. I believe that any tool that restricts an organization&#8217;s access to its data and its ability to share its data how it sees fit should be strongly discouraged. I believe that users bear the ultimate responsibility for understanding the technologies that they choose. I believe there is nothing more interoperable than a URL. I believe lots of other things learned through patience, experience, and collaboration.</p>

<p>If I were employed by a vendor or a vendor-like organization, I may take a slightly more partisan view. I also don&#8217;t begrudge such organizations their own biases. I expect them to be loyal to their tools and to want to see them used and improved through that use. I would be suspect of them if they weren&#8217;t.</p>

<p>That, however, is not the case with me. So, believing that open is better than closed, my responsibility is to ensure that my own thinking and my own mind are kept open. That&#8217;s something that I always know, but it is good to be reminded of it by being immersed in a community that is strongly focused on a goal.</p>

    <id>http://blog.geomusings.com/2013/06/18/geojson-on-github-now-what</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So <a href="http://github.com">GitHub</a> <a href="https://github.com/blog/1528-there-s-a-map-for-that">announced</a> that you can now automatically view any <a href="http://geojson.org">GeoJSON</a> files that may be in a repository inside an interactive map driven by <a href="http://www.mapbox.com/">MapBox</a> technology. This simple enhancement to GitHub is probably one of the most significant developments in the geospatial industry in years. I&#8217;ll explain a little later in this post. It&#8217;s also important to view this new capability as a great, but limited, first step. I&#8217;ll discuss that a little later as well.</p>

<p>While it&#8217;s cool to click on a link and just see a map, it doesn&#8217;t take long to wonder about how you can use this capability beyond viewing data in GitHub. What follows are three ways to capitalize on GeoJSON in GitHub. Not all are directly related to the new mapping capability, and two have been possible for a long time. That said, the GitHub announcement may draw interest from users who have not previously considered either GitHub or GeoJSON, so I hope these approaches will be useful.</p>

<h3>Embed the GitHub map.</h3>

<p><del>If you click on a GeoJSON file and view the new map in GitHub, a quick view of the page source will show that this map is embedded in an IFRAME object.</del> GitHub provides a <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/mapping-geojson-files-on-github#embedding-your-map-elsewhere">simple embedding method</a> to display the GitHub map in any page. (Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/benbalter">Ben Balter</a> for this update.) It&#8217;s a great way to quickly publish a data set while also providing access to download the raw data.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><script src="https://embed.github.com/view/geojson/geobabbler/geodata/master/geojson/leonardtown_bldgs.geojson"></script></p>

<!--more-->


<h3>Stream the data into your own web map.</h3>

<p>This is not a new capability; if you&#8217;ve had GeoJSON in a repo, you&#8217;ve always been able to do this. That said, if you&#8217;re checking out GitHub or GeoJSON for the first time as a result of the new mapping capability, this is something you may want to try. I have had a page up for a while showing the <a href="http://blog.geomusings.com/assets/demos/mdq6/">county-by-bounty breakdown of Maryland&#8217;s marriage equality question from the 2012 election</a> that uses this approach to load the data into a <a href="http://leafletjs.com/">Leaflet</a> map from GitHub and style it. (Incidentally, the tiles in the map are also hosted on GitHub.)</p>

<h3>Stream the data into your desktop.</h3>

<p>A third option is to stream the GeoJSON data directly into desktop GIS software such as QGIS for further analysis. In QGIS, simply need to add a vector, specifying &#8220;Protocol&#8221; and entering the URL to your GitHub-hosted GeoJSON file. Make sure you use the &#8220;raw&#8221; URL that looks something like this: https://raw.github.com/geobabbler/geodata/master/geojson/leonardtown_bldgs.geojson .</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://blog.geomusings.com/images/posts/add_geojson_layer.png" /></p>

<p>After a few seconds (or more depending on the file size), it should load into QGIS like this:</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://blog.geomusings.com/images/posts/qgis_github_geojson.png" /></p>

<p>Additionally, the <a href="https://github.com/RBURHUM/arcgis-ogr/">GDAL/OGR plug-in for ArcGIS</a> by <a href="http://www.amigocloud.com/homepage/index.html">AmigoCloud</a> provides a way to get GeoJSON into ArcMap, though you may need to download the data first.</p>

<p>UPDATE: Dane Springmeyer pointed out that TileMill supports remote URLs as well.</p>

<div class='embed tweet'><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/geomusingsblog">@geomusingsblog</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/billdollins">@billdollins</a> - very cool, had no idea QGIS supported remote urls. TileMill does also: <a href="http://t.co/o3wxv2VkEv">http://t.co/o3wxv2VkEv</a></p>&mdash; Dane Springmeyer (@springmeyer) <a href="https://twitter.com/springmeyer/statuses/347483526171594753">June 19, 2013</a></blockquote>
<script async src="http://blog.geomusings.com//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>


<p>Those are three (or so) quick ways to capitalize on GeoJSON data in GitHub now. So what next?</p>

<p>I stated earlier that I think the GitHub announcement was one of the most significant developments in years. I think it is best explained by <a href="http://feomike.github.io/post/thoughts-on-disruption.html">feoMike in his recent post</a>. As he points out, GitHub has made it easy to communicate spatial information in a way that is fully consistent with the web. Now that simple mapping is available to a large community of developers, it will be interesting to see where they take it. feoMike offered up a few early examples in his post. It&#8217;s worth a read.</p>

<p>The GitHub move is great for GeoJSON as a format. I&#8217;ve said in the past that the search for the next shapefile ends with GeoJSON. If the web is this generation&#8217;s dominant computing platform (it is), then GeoJSON provides a simple, elegant solution for geographic data transport in a manner that the shapefile did for the desktop. Support by GitHub is one more example of the community voting with its code as to what it prefers.</p>

<p>I also said it was a great first step, but limited. The mapping capability is understandably basic, though the documentation shows how you can customize styling somewhat. There is also a point at which the data seems to become too big to render (in either the map or in raw form). Bill Morris has identified this limit to be in the ballpark of 4.5MB, which can be easy to hit with GeoJSON.</p>

<div class='embed tweet'><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/byrne_tweets">@byrne_tweets</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/BenBalter">@BenBalter</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/ericg">@ericg</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/ajturner">@ajturner</a> +1 for a solid number on max renderable filesize. 4.5MB is pushing it: <a href="https://t.co/cNTbA5Djqw">https://t.co/cNTbA5Djqw</a></p>&mdash; Bill Morris (@vtcraghead) <a href="https://twitter.com/vtcraghead/statuses/346825523521019904">June 18, 2013</a></blockquote>
<script async src="http://blog.geomusings.com//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>


<p>So this means that enterprises won&#8217;t be dumping terabytes of vectors to GeoJSON and loading them into GitHub. That&#8217;s a good thing in my book. It is, however, an acceptable solution for small data sets and quick turn-around data sharing. As with all things, you have to go in with the right set of expectations.</p>

<p>The thing I&#8217;m probably least worried about is how this affects <a href="http://www.esri.com">Esri</a>. Without any specific inside knowledge of Esri&#8217;s plans, I suspect some form of official support for GeoJSON isn&#8217;t far off. There are too many people inside Esri who get GeoJSON for it not to happen. If anything, the GitHub announcement may provide a bit of a push by providing a potentially rich source of data sets to consume. The real question is what form the support will take. In any event, Esri provides enough APIs to enable us to develop our own support for GeoJSON if we need it.</p>

<p>The addition of GeoJSON mapping to GitHub is a very small change in the scheme of that platform, but such small changes can sometimes lead to big shifts. It has been possible for a long time to use GitHub to host geospatial data for applications. The main benefit of this latest change, in my opinion, is its potential to get people thinking about the platform in a different way. With such a visible (and visual) change on a platform targeted at developers, I hope that it will motivate that community to begin experimenting with how far it can be pushed. If a hosted platform with an already-baked-in workflow for change management and version control begins to be viewed as a viable home for spatial data, it has the potential to change how the geospatial community thinks about how it does business.</p>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[GeoJSON from ArcGIS Server]]></title>
    <link href="http://blog.geomusings.com/2013/06/10/geojson-from-arcgis-server/"/>
    <updated>2013-06-10T09:54:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.geomusings.com/2013/06/10/geojson-from-arcgis-server</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A while back, I posted about <a href="http://blog.geomusings.com/2011/11/15/fgeojson/">my desire to see GeoJSON supported as an output format from ArcGIS Server</a>. I found myself needing that capability so I recently completed, <a href="https://github.com/geobabbler/AGSOpenFormats">and posted to GitHub</a>, a first cut at a server object extension (SOE) for ArcGIS Server 10.1 that enables output of <a href="http://geojson.org/">GeoJSON</a> via an HTTP GET.</p>

<p>Using the SOE is fairly straightforward. If you download the code and build it (ensuring you have installed the ArcObjects SDK for .Net), you can simply move the project outputs to your target machine and use the ArcGIS Server manager to install the SOE. Once you log into the manager application, click &#8220;Site&#8221; at the top of the page and then &#8220;Extensions&#8221; on the left. Click &#8220;Add Extension&#8221; and browse to the .soe file. You should end up seeing something like this:</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"> <img src="http://blog.geomusings.com/images/posts/geojsonserver1.png" /></p>

<!--more-->


<p>After, that you can go back to &#8220;Services,&#8221; choose a map service, select &#8220;Capabilities,&#8221; and you should see &#8220;Open Data Formats&#8221; as a choice to select. At that point, you should be ready to go.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"> <img src="http://blog.geomusings.com/images/posts/geojsonserver2.png" /></p>

<p>That&#8217;s all meat-and-potatoes configuration workflow that <a href="http://www.esri.com">Esri</a> has made very easy at 10.1. Once you&#8217;ve been through all of that, you should be able to go to your map service properties using a URL like this:</p>

<p>http://localhost/arcgis/rest/services/SampleWorldCities/MapServer</p>

<p>&#8230;and you should see be able to scroll to the bottom and see &#8220;GeoJSONServer&#8221; (which will change in a future version) as a supported extension.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"> <img src="http://blog.geomusings.com/images/posts/geojsonserver4.png" /></p>

<p>Following that link should take you to a page that shows &#8220;GeoJSON&#8221; as a supported operation. From there, you should be taken to a page that allows you to enter in a layer number (required) or a query (optional). The layer number is the layer&#8217;s ordinal shown in the map service properties above. The query parameter can be a SQL WHERE clause that is valid for the layer in question (leaving off the word &#8220;WHERE&#8221;). This is consistent with how definition queries are handled elsewhere in the Esri REST API. At this point, GET and POST do the same thing though that may change in the future. You can use this form (which is generated by default) to test the SOE and get examples of valid URLs. For example, this URL returns GeoJSON for the continent of Asia from my sample map service:</p>

<p>http://localhost/arcgis/rest/services/SampleWorldCities/MapServer/exts/GeoJSONServer/GeoJSON?query=CONTINENT%3D%27Asia%27&amp;layer=1&amp;f=json</p>

<p>In the process of developing the SOE, I tested the outputs using <a href="http://geojsonlint.com/">geojsonlint.com</a> and the <a href="http://openlayers.org/dev/examples/vector-formats.html">OpenLayers vector format example</a> page (see the following screen shot).</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"> <img src="http://blog.geomusings.com/images/posts/geojsonserver5.png" /></p>

<p>A few nuts and bolts:</p>

<ol>
<li>I refactored my previous <a href="http://blog.geomusings.com/2012/08/24/togeojson-and-towkt-for-the-esri-fgdb-api/">extension methods for the File Geodatabase API</a> to work with ArcObjects for this SOE. The code is functional but I&#8217;d call the conversion about 75% complete. A close examination by an experienced ArcObjects developer may lead to some head-scratching as there are some artifacts from the FGDB API oriented code that I&#8217;ll be cleaning up over the next couple of weeks.</li>
<li>The SOE is currently output-only and only supports attribute queries. I plan to work on the ability to pass in a GeoJSON geometry to do a spatial filter as well but my GeoJSON code currently only persists Esri geometries to GeoJSON but does not yet de-persist. For the sake of consistency, I don&#8217;t want to mix JSON syntax, so I want to add in de-persistence before implementing spatial filters.</li>
<li>The SOE always transforms geometries to WGS84 for GeoJSON output. The GeoJSON spec doesn&#8217;t specifically require this; it was just my call.</li>
<li>The SOE has been tested with ArcGIS Server 10.1 only. I don&#8217;t know if the current code will present any issues with previous versions but I really have no plans to go back and test them. The actual GeoJSON generation shouldn&#8217;t be much of an issue but I can&#8217;t speak for the SOE interface itself. Forks are welcome.</li>
</ol>


<p>As can be seen, the code is still under active development but it works in its current configuration. It&#8217;s actually performed pretty well on a very modest Amazon instance so I&#8217;m somewhat encouraged. I&#8217;ll post some issues to GitHub as a nominal road map.</p>

<p>In a semi-related note, it looks like Marten Hogeweg of Esri is working on integrating GeoJSON support into Esri&#8217;s portal server project, so users of that tool may want to hold on for that.</p>

<div class='embed tweet'><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>So&#8230; looking at adding <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23geojson&amp;src=hash">#geojson</a> to <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23esri&amp;src=hash">#esri</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23opensource&amp;src=hash">#opensource</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23geoportal&amp;src=hash">#geoportal</a> server.

    <link href="http://blog.geomusings.com/2013/05/30/ogc-abandons-the-web/"/>
    <updated>2013-05-30T10:52:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.geomusings.com/2013/05/30/ogc-abandons-the-web</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Those are my words, not theirs.</p>

<p>It came to light today that <a href="http://www.opengeospatial.org/">OGC</a> has decided to <a href="http://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/discuss/2013-May/011789.html">withdraw the GeoServices REST Specification</a>, also known as the &#8220;ESRI REST API,&#8221; as a proposed standard. I will not take up the relative merits of the specification or the implications of OGC potentially adopting an industry-developed specification that has so much implied workflow embedded in it. With this decision, three facts remain unaltered:</p>

<ol>
<li>The ESRI REST API will continue forward as a widely-used de facto standard in the form of ArcGIS Server installs and other emulations, such as that in <a href="http://www.arc2earth.com/">Arc2Earth</a>.</li>
<li>GeoJSON will continue forward as a widely-used de facto standard in the form of numerous open-source implementations.</li>
<li>OGC still has no JSON syntax.</li>
</ol>


<p>Yes, twelve years after the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON#History">birth of JSON</a>, five years after the <a href="http://webhelp.esri.com/arcgisserver/9.3/java/index.htm#whats_new_93.htm">release of the ESRI REST API and its embedded JSON syntax</a>, and five years after the <a href="http://geojson.org/geojson-spec.html">release of GeoJSON 1.0</a>, OGC is still has no entry in the JSON space. Between Esri and GeoJSON, the utility of JSON in web mapping applications has been roundly proven. In the ESRI arena, find me anyone who willingly uses the SOAP API these days while the adoption of support for GeoJSON across the open-source GIS world speaks volumes. The industry has voted with its feet and its code as to what it prefers.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s probably a lively discussion to be had about where JSON should fit into OGC&#8217;s priorities. What is clear, however, is that Javascript and JSON are driving the web at large and the web-mapping space in the geospatial market. With no official stance of any kind in this area, it becomes increasingly difficult to take OGC seriously in matters of the modern web.</p>

<p>Howard Butler had a great point a while back when discussing the potential adoption of the GeoServices REST Specification:</p>

<div class='embed tweet'><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/JeffHarrison">@JeffHarrison</a> I think it would be great for OGC to ratify GeoServices. It would cement their irrelevance to current and future developers.</p>&mdash; Howard Butler (@howardbutler) <a href="https://twitter.com/howardbutler/statuses/331405667837542401">May 6, 2013</a></blockquote>
<script async src="http://blog.geomusings.com//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>


<p>The irony here is that the withdrawal of the specification accomplishes the same thing. I won&#8217;t go so far as to say OGC has no clue or doesn&#8217;t care but, in the perception-is-reality department, they look pretty out-of-touch these days. Is this a problem with process? Maybe. Is it a problem with message? Definitely. The message I&#8217;ve gotten from this whole episode is that we can keep doing what we&#8217;ve been doing with our web mapping applications because OGC has nothing for us.</p>

<p>Having seen Dr. Lembo and his team in action <a href="http://blog.geomusings.com/2013/03/20/the-best-thing-i-saw-at-tugis-2013/">for an afternoon at TUGIS</a>, I think this will be a good way for those who have been wanting to take the leap with open-source GIS tools to get some hands-on experience with core tools like <a href="http://qgis.org/">QGIS</a> and <a href="http://postgis.net/">PostGIS</a>. It&#8217;s also a great time of year to be on Maryland&#8217;s Eastern Shore.

    <updated>2013-04-25T14:00:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.geomusings.com/2013/04/25/simple-tile-viewer</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We do a lot of tiles for various customers at <a href="http://www.zekiah.com">Zekiah</a>. Tiling is as much art as science and sometimes things go wrong so we have a range of utilities that we use to perform various kids of QA. Because the caches can be large, we usually want to perform a visual QA on the static tiles before pushing them up to wherever they are going to live full-time.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"> <img src="http://blog.geomusings.com/images/posts/cacheviewer2.png" /></p>

<p>In order to facilitate that, I wrote a very simple tile viewer using <a href="http://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a> and <a href="http://leafletjs.com/">Leaflet</a>. It uses a config file to get everything it needs to operate so we just make our changes there. This application currently only works with Web Mercator tiles but I&#8217;m working on adding support for WGS84. It also doesn&#8217;t work with &#8216;compact&#8217; tiles from ArcGIS Server. It obviously requires Node, and it also requires an <a href="https://npmjs.org/">NPM</a> install of the &#8216;open&#8217; module to facilitate opening the browser.</p>

<p>Anything else you need to know is in the readme. I hope you find it useful. It can be <a href="https://github.com/geobabbler/cacheview">downloaded here</a>.</p>

    <updated>2013-04-24T13:40:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.geomusings.com/2013/04/24/when-is-a-geoportal-not-a-geoportal</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When it&#8217;s really a desktop application.</p>

<p>Over the past few weeks, I have been reading with conflicted agreement the posts of <a href="http://mapbrief.com/2013/02/21/the-waiting-is-the-hardest-part-why-map-portals-dont-work-part-v/">Brian Timoney</a> and <a href="http://geosprocket.blogspot.com/2013/04/toward-ideal-geoportal.html">Bill Morris</a> about the nature of geo-portals and what they should or should not be and do. I say that I am in conflicted agreement not because I take any issue with anything they have said. Their posts represent what should be considered best practices in terms of building web mapping applications. In Brian&#8217;s posts, the counter-examples he highlights represent some of the worst practices to be avoided.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"> <img src="http://blog.geomusings.com/images/posts/arcmap_browser.png" /></p>

<p>My conflict arises from the fact that, while I agree with the ideas that Brian and Bill put forward, I find myself working against them in my current work. In my <a href="http://www.spatiallyadjusted.com/2013/04/10/hangouts-with-james-fee-developer-i-hardly-knew-her/">hangout with James Fee</a> a couple of weeks ago, I mentioned that I am working again (albeit temporarily) in the world of Silverlight. I am supporting a very large, complex Silverlight application that, as one of many functions, includes a mapping module that runs counter to almost every best practice espoused by Brian and Bill. And I am adding to it.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>The main difference with this application is that it will never be a public-facing internet application. It is intended to be deployed to a limited user base in an intranet/extranet environment. One of the overarching goals is to deliver sophisticated analytical tools and a desktop-like experience to the user community. So why not simply deliver a desktop application, or a series of extensions to ArcGIS, or both?</p>

<p>The answer to that is simply &#8220;enterprise IT policy.&#8221; This particular organization works under an IT policy framework that makes it nearly impossible to deploy custom desktop applications. This is not a unique situation as restrictive IT policies exist in many large organizations, especially Federal agencies. Some of that policy exists in the name of security, which is a laudable goal, but good developers with clear policy requirements, working in collaboration with IA staff, can secure an application regardless of how it is deployed. A larger driver is reduction of configuration management costs. It is simply expensive to identify specific users, ensure their systems meet proper specifications, deliver desktop tools to them, and sustain those tools over time. This, of course, has been one of advantages of web applications from the outset.  So &#8220;stuffing the desktop into the browser&#8221; looks like an attractive path and it is for development that must meet requirements within a budget and a schedule. Anything that reduces the friction of dealing with IT policy is a win.</p>

<p>This is all well and good within the confines of one&#8217;s own intranet. What happens behind the firewall stays behind the firewall&#8230;except for when it doesn&#8217;t. Poor application design is poor application design regardless of which side of the firewall on which it sits. When draconian IT policy enshrines the adoption of something-less-than-best practices, we all lose. Groupthink begins to set in and developers that spend their time building plugin-based, should-be-desktop applications on the intranet for a targeted audience of GIS users can begin to lose perspective on what makes a suitable interface for the general user. Eventually, those intranet practices will begin to be exposed on public-facing applications because many developers will continue to do what they have learned (and have been encouraged) to do.</p>

<p>Any enterprise that is sufficiently large enough to have instituted a heavy IT policy is probably engaged in some level of software development and/or customization. That policy should be flexible enough to enable users and developers to choose the right tool and/or architecture for the job, rather than turning one particular architecture (HTTP in this case) into a one-size-fits-all channel for inappropriately designed tools and practices.</p>

    <link href="http://blog.geomusings.com/2013/03/28/sharpmap-1-dot-0-rc1-released/"/>
    <updated>2013-03-28T06:10:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.geomusings.com/2013/03/28/sharpmap-1-dot-0-rc1-released</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Over on Google+, <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/117900686009614580552/posts">Diego Guidi</a> let me know that the <a href="http://sharpmap.codeplex.com/releases/view/104098">SharpMap 1.0 Release Candidate has been released</a>. There was a time when I worked with, <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ablog.geomusings.com&amp;q=sharpmap">and wrote about</a>, SharpMap a lot. During that entire time, the stable version of SharpMap sat at some version number that started with &#8220;0.9&#8221;. The release of a 1.0 candidate is a signal that the project is moving forward.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"> <img src="http://www.zekiah.com/sites/default/files/images/SharpMapSQL2008.preview.png" /></p>

<p>This is important because there are still an awful lot of .Net developers out there, especially in government shops that made a big Microsoft push in terms of infrastructure and training years ago. Of course, many of those shops are also committed to Esri technologies but SharpMap, while being a fully-functioning mapping/GIS library, also provides easy access to data sources not natively supported by Esri. Additionally, it is very easy to extend to support new or custom data sources and strightforward to <a href="http://www.zekiah.com/index.php?q=node/146">get SharpMap to play nicely in traditionally Esri-centric environments</a>.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>At <a href="http://www.zekiah.com">my company</a> we&#8217;ve used SharpMap for just that for one of our key Navy customers. By building custom SharpMap data sources, we&#8217;ve been able to encapsulate business logic in Oracle, including the use of Oracle <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/shawty_ds/what-is-spatial-sql">Spatial SQL</a> to execute spatial analysis processes and deliver the results back to an Esri web client that is also interacting with ArcGIS Server for many standard functions. SharpMap enabled us to expose this logic through an HTTP+JSON interface while bypassing geodatabases, server object extensions, and other such cruft.</p>

<p>In recent years, other open-source .Net projects such as <a href="https://dotspatial.codeplex.com/">DotSpatial</a> have gained traction and that&#8217;s good. The .Net environment remains in widespread use so it is useful to have open-source geospatial options for that platform. I&#8217;m happy to see SharpMap remaining an option in that space.</p>

    <id>http://blog.geomusings.com/2013/03/25/loose-ends</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Just a quick note to tidy up some loose ends related to recent posts&#8230;</p>

<p>First, regarding the post &#8221;<a href="http://blog.geomusings.com/2013/03/17/a-lazyweb-compendium-of-python-resources-for-beginners/">A #LazyWeb Compendium of Python Resources for Beginners</a>,&#8221; the University of South Florida PyBulls Python interest group, as promised, compiled a list of Python resources and posted it <a href="https://github.com/PyBulls/learning-resources">on their GitHub page</a>. Thanks to them for their quick response.</p>

<p>Second, following up on the post &#8221;<a href="http://blog.geomusings.com/2013/03/20/the-best-thing-i-saw-at-tugis-2013/">The Best Thing I Saw at TUGIS 2013</a>,&#8221; the data and workbooks for Dr. Arthur Lembo&#8217;s introduction to open-source GIS have been made available. The data <a href="https://github.com/esrgc/qgistraining">can be found on GitHub</a> and the workbooks can be found on the <a href="http://www.esrgc.org/training/">Eastern Shore Regional GIS Cooperative web site</a>. Many thanks for contributing these resources.</p>

<p>These items are embedded in the comments for their respective posts but I thought it would be useful to call them out more prominently.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I spent the day yesterday at <a href="http://www.towson.edu/">Towson University</a> attending the <a href="http://www.towson.edu/tugis/">TUGIS 2013</a> conference. The new one-day format was a firehose that showcased the diversity of geospatial work occurring across the State of Maryland. The keynote by <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=44978536">Learon Dalby</a> was well-received and the content of the conference was generally substantive. While the day was a sprint, there was one workshop that really caught my attention more so than I would have thought from its title.</p>

<p>The photo below shows 40 participants of an &#8220;Introduction to Free and Open Source GIS Software&#8221; workshop getting hands-on experience with <a href="http://www.qgis.org">QGIS</a> and <a href="http://www.postgis.org">PostGIS</a> by working through prepared but realistic scenarios. These scenarios included doing multi-user editing and performing spatial analysis to assess the effects of a potential toxic release over a small town.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"> <img src="http://blog.geomusings.com/images/posts/tugis2013_workshop.jpg" /></p>

<p>The workshop was put together by <a href="http://faculty.salisbury.edu/~ajlembo/">Dr. Arthur Lembo</a> of <a href="http://www.salisbury.edu/">Salisbury University</a> and conducted by him and a team of his students, who not only led portions of the workshop but were also stationed around the room to provide guidance to participants. The scenarios were prepared in printed workbooks that the participants were free to take with them, along with information about how to download the tools. All-in-all, I thought the workshop was very well-designed and presented a thorough overview of the capabilities of these two tools.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>To be sure, the workshop was not all unicorns and rainbows. There were typical glitches such as file system and database permission issues that required on-the-fly adjustments, which Dr. Lembo and his students handled well. Some participants were clearly stumped at points while others were making good headway with the examples.</p>

<p>Many of the participants probably remain committed <a href="http://www.esri.com">ArcGIS</a> users after the workshop while others may very well dig in and more thoroughly explore QGIS and PostGIS, but that&#8217;s really beside the point. Regardless of what the individual participants decide to do with the information from the workshop, all left with hands-on exposure to the tools that was presented in a manner that was free of hyperbole, FUD, or market-speak. They now have more first-hand information with which to make their own educated decisions as to how they want to proceed with their geospatial technology choices; and that, in my opinion, may have been the most valuable outcome of the workshop.</p>

There&#8217;s an intro session featuring <a href="http://www.postgresql.org">PostgreSQL</a>, <a href="http://www.postgis.org">PostGIS</a>, <a href="http://qgis.org">QGIS</a>, and <a href="http://geoserver.org">GeoServer</a> presented by <a href="http://www.salisbury.edu/">Salisbury State University</a>. Salisbury was once known as a bastion of <a href="http://www.manifold.net/">Manifold</a> so they&#8217;ve got a long history of thinking outside the Arc. Additionally, there is a session (by Towson University) discussing the use of <a href="http://www.gdal.org">GDAL</a>, <a href="http://www.gdal.org/ogr/">OGR</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/sgillies/shapely">Shapely</a> in the development of a spatial service.</p>

<p>One thing I like about regional GIS conferences like this is that they tend to focus more on solutions to real-world problems instead of the latest technological bells and whistles. I spend so much of my time with my head in Federal requirements that it&#8217;s nice do a reset and get different perspectives on how geospatial technologies are used. I am particularly interested to hear the keynote from <a href="http://twitter.com/learondalby">Learon Dalby</a> of <a href="http://www.sanborn.com/">Sanborn</a> and formerly of the <a href="http://www.gis.state.ar.us/">Arkansas GIO office</a>. I had the pleasure of working with Learon and the AGIO team on a project a couple of years ago and am impressed with what they accomplished.</p>

<p>I appreciate the new format of TUGIS as a one-day event is much easier to fit into the schedule. I&#8217;m looking forward to it.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A friend who is in the midst of a career change and moving into the GIS world asked me for some pointers to resources for getting started with Python. I threw the question out to Twitter (with a similar variation also posted to Google+):</p>

<div class='embed tweet'><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>Can anyone recommend any good online Python training sources for beginners? Asking for a friend in the midst of a career change.</p>&mdash; Bill Dollins (@billdollins) <a href="https://twitter.com/billdollins/status/313263420923338753">March 17, 2013</a></blockquote>

<p>I got a couple of requests to summarize any information I received, which seemed reasonable. I got quite a few responses and here are some links:</p>

<p>I can&#8217;t claim to have checked out all of them, but I consider the recommendations to have come from trusted sources. So, if you&#8217;re <a href="http://blog.geomusings.com/2013/01/30/yes-you-need-to-code/">looking to expand your GIS expertise by adding some Python knowledge</a>, these may be a good place to start. Not all of them are free-of-charge since that wasn&#8217;t one of my friend&#8217;s requirements.</p>

<p>Additionally, Dan Dye informs me that the PyBulls Python interest group at the University of South Florida will take up this question and post a document with a list of resources on GitHub. Be sure to keep an eye on <a href="https://github.com/pybulls/">https://github.com/pybulls/</a> . Thank you!</p>
