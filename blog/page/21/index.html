  <div class="entry-content"><p>The <a href="http://www.mapwindow.org/">MapWindow</a> open-source project will be holding its <a href="http://www.mapwindow.org/conference/2010/index.php">first-ever user conference</a> from March 31 to April 2, 2010 in Orlando, Florida. Aside from being a great milestone for MapWindow, it is also being billed as a &#8220;coming out party&#8221; for MapWindow  6, its first native .NET version.</p>

<p>For those of you who are not familiar with MapWindow, it is and open-source (MPL 1.1) mapping library (think SharpMap or MapObjects) for use in developing applications, managed by the Geospatial Software Lab at Idaho State University. Although its desktop application and some geoprocessing tools have been written in .NET (VB.NET and C# respectively) for some time, the main library has been a 32-bit ActiveX control written in C++. At version 6, it will finally be fully .NET.</p>

<p>I had used MapWindow a little bit some years ago but haven&#8217;t recently due to its ActiveX structure. I will definitely add it to my (ever-growing) list of things to check out now that it&#8217;s been ported.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As I <a href="http://geobabble.wordpress.com/2009/06/30/5th-gvsig-conference-announced/">posted before</a>, the 5th <a href="http://www.gvsig.gva.es/index.php?id=gvsig&amp;L=2">gvSIG</a> conference is scheduled for December 2-4, 2009 in Valencia. I got an e-mail reminder that communication proposals (presentations, posters, etc.) are due by September 21st. From the e-mail:</p>

<blockquote>
We remind you that we are now expecting communication proposals for the 5th gvSIG Conference (Valencia, 2nd-4th December 2009) [1]. The deadline is September 21st.

You just have to send an abstract, following the template provided on the Reports section of the Conference web page [2] to contacto-jornadas-gvsig@gva.es and the scientific committee will evaluate it to be in the conference programme.

There are two types of communications: presentation and poster. The communications have to be preferably related to the gvSIG project and the following issues will be also be considered in the evaluation:

  * Innovation.
  * Usefulness for the GIS community.
  * Usefulness for the free open source community.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So the <a href="http://support.esri.com/index.cfm?fa=knowledgebase.documentation.viewDoc&amp;PID=17&amp;MetaID=1555">upcoming release</a> of ArcGIS 9.3.1 SP1 <a href="http://downloads2.esri.com/support/documentation/ao_/9.3.1_SP1_Announcement9_1.pdf">addresses a lot of issues</a>. I am somewhat curious why it&#8217;s not being called 9.3.2. Calling it a service pack seems to be mixing metaphors. Hopefully, ESRI will reconsider before it hits the street.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Back in the early 1990s, toward the end of the administration of George H. W. Bush and into the beginning of the Clinton administration, we were in a bit of a recession. It was not as bad as things are right now but, to someone who had just graduated from college, it was a tough environment. Even the US Government had a hiring freeze on. There was just no work to be had.</p>

<p>In the summer of 1993, I was bartender at the Chili&#8217;s in Waldorf, MD. I had about 8 years of restaurant experience and a freshly minted degree in Information Systems Management from the University of Maryland Baltimore County and very little else to recommend me in the face of so many college graduates and laid-off people with experience also looking for work.</p>

<p>One of our regulars was a guy named Mark. He wasn&#8217;t my regular so much as Ed&#8217;s, who was the senior bartender that I worked with on Fridays. He and his girlfriend (future wife)  would come in for dinner and have a beer or two while waiting for a table. Waldorf was much smaller then and Chili&#8217;s was really the only game in town at the time.</p>

<p>Mark would also come in maybe once or twice a week after work and have a beer or two during the week. It was during one of these visits that he told me about a contract his company had just gotten digitizing Army bases for the chemical weapons treaty. I mentioned my degree and expressed interest if he was hiring and, a few days later, sent him my resume. Until he got my resume, he didn&#8217;t know my last name and I didn&#8217;t know his.</p>

<p>Eventually, I landed that job working for Mark Quasius at Applied Ordnance Technology (AOT). It got me started in a field that I had heard mentioned once, in passing, during a lecture in college: geographic information systems. During that job, I got exposed to AutoCAD, MapInfo, ARC/INFO (6.something), and ArcView 2.0. I got to do some programming in AML, MapBasic and a little bit of Clipper. I met a lot of really good and patient people, did some cool stuff, made some mistakes, learned from it all and moved on after about three years.</p>

<p>During my time at AOT, Mark got assigned to the Crystal City office and we didn&#8217;t work directly together as much. After I left, I lost touch with him but usually heard when he changed jobs and heard that he was having health problems a few years back. Yesterday, I learned that Mark Quasius passed away on August 9, too young, at the age of 45 after a long battle with cancer. Here is his <a href="http://www.sheboyganpress.com/article/20090813/SHE010301/908130348/1067/SHE01">obituary</a>.</p>

<p>When I was leaving AOT, Mark told me the story of how I got that first job. Essentially, he had a big stack of resumes from applicants, many of whom looked stronger on paper. He felt he had something of an impression about me from our interactions at Chili&#8217;s and decided to take a chance on me. That decision earned him some quizzical looks from the owners but they left the decision up to him.</p>

<p>So Mark Quasius gave me my first &#8220;real job&#8221; in the summer of 1993 and set me off on a career that I didn&#8217;t expect. For that, I will always be grateful to him. At the risk of sounding cliche, he should have had more time. Goodbye, Mark and thank you.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Ryan Sarver <a href="http://blog.twitter.com/2009/08/location-location-location.html">announced today</a> the availability of a geolocation API for Twitter. It even supports GeoRSS and GeoJSON. This could be a potentially significant new step for Twitter. It looks like the API will be opened to <del datetime="2009-08-20T23:50:17+00:00">platform developers first</del> everyone (see <a href="http://twitter.com/rsarver/statuses/3437734477">here</a>).</p>

<p>Tying in location to the near-real-time nature of the Twitter timeline opens up lots of potential location-based applications. Let the slippy-mapping commence!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Looks like ArcGIS Explorer 900 has dropped. It was pretty nice in beta and it&#8217;s good to see that it&#8217;s out now. It can be downloaded <a href="http://resources.esri.com/arcgisexplorer/900/index.cfm?fa=download">here</a>. The ribbon interface is nice. I&#8217;ve always liked the ribbon but I wasn&#8217;t a fan of how it was unceremoniously dropped on us in Office.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Alessandro made two announcements today. First SpatiaLite 2.3.1 has been released. Changes include:</p>

<blockquote>
* including SQLite v.3.6.16
* including GEOS.3 1.1
* added SQL version functions: spatialite_version(),
  proj4_version(), geos_version()
* added SQL functions: IsTiffBlob(), IsWaveletBlob()
  [RasterLite compatibility]
* now supporting the &#8216;F&#8217; (float) datatype for DBF
  [while reading some Shapefile]

bug fixes:

* fixed a stupid initialization bug disabling MbrCache
* fixed a stupid initialization bug disabling VirtualFDO
* fixed some EXIF and EXIF-GPS inconsistencies
* fixed incorrect SRID handling for PointN(), GeometryN() ..
* fixed a nasty error [causing a crash] while parsing
  degenerated WKT geometries (single-vertex LINESTRING &#8230;)
* fixed some ./configure oddities
  [&#8211;with-proj-include, &#8211;with-geos-include]
* and many others &#8230;
</blockquote>


<p>Also from Alessandro, RasterLite 1.0:</p>

<blockquote>
today I released RasterLite, a really simple SpatiaLite-based C API [and related command-line management tools] supporting Raster Data Sources in a SpatiaLite DB.

RasterLite implements TILING and multi-level PYRAMIDS, and take full profit from RTree-based Spatial Indexing.

Individual tiles can be stored at your choice as:
TIFF     [supporting monochrome CCITT FAX-4 compression]
PNG      [loseless compression]
GIF      [loseless compression]
JPEG     [lossy compression]
WAVELET  [lossy compression]

As from my preliminary testings, RasterLite is able to handle really huge Raster Data Sources [several GB-sized] in a really efficient and painless way.

You can find a tutorial explaining in depth how to use the following popular publicly available satellite imagery and DEMs:
- TrueMarble 250m/pixel world coverage
- ETOPO5 wold coverage
- SRTM 90m/pixel world coverage
</blockquote>


<p>Information on both can be found at the <a href="http://www.gaia-gis.it/spatialite">SpatiaLite web site</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I got this announcement in my inbox today regarding <a href="http://www.gvsig.gva.es/index.php?id=gvsig&amp;L=2">gvSIG</a>, an open-source GIS desktop <a href="http://www.osgeo.org/gvsig">currently in</a> the <a href="http://www.osgeo.org/">OSGEO</a> <a href="http://www.osgeo.org/incubator">incubator</a>. If you are a gvSIG user, the 5th gvSIG Conference will be held this year in Valencia, Spain. See below for the full text:</p>

<blockquote>
The 5th Edition of the gvSIG Conference [1], organized by the Regional Ministry of Infrastructure and Transport (CIT), will be held from December 2nd until December 4th at the Feria Valencia Convention and Exhibition Center, and will once again host the eclipseDay.

In these difficult times when collaboration is most important, we cope with the adversities together with the aim of coming out strengthened by them. We continue moving ahead together. This is part of the gvSIG project and through this approach we keep on growing. This is our slogan for the fifth edition of the gvSIG Conference: We keep growing.

The call for papers for the Fifth Edition of the gvSIG conference is now open. As of today communication proposals can be sent to the email address: <a href="mailto:contacto-jornadas-gvsig@gva.es">contacto-jornadas-gvsig@gva.es</a>; they will be evaluated by the scientific committee as to their inclusion in the conference program. There are two types of communication: paper or poster. Information regarding to regulations on communication presentations can be found in the report&#8217;s section [2]. Abstracts will be accepted until September 21st .

Organizations interested in collaborating in the event can find information in the section: How to collaborate? [3]

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It&#8217;s been an extremely busy few months, as evidenced by the pace (or lack thereof) of blogging. I have been hopping between customer sites, mainly helping with ArcGIS Server implementations. We&#8217;re also re-hosting an ArcIMS site for someone. I expect that to eventually transition as well but we have to get it moved first. I&#8217;m also working a pro-bono implementation of PostGIS/GeoServer/OpenLayers for the town of Green Mountain Falls, Colorado. That&#8217;s been fun. It&#8217;s great to see how a small town can marshall it resources (Boys Scouts with GPS collected trails as an Eagle Scout project) to get things done. The initial implementation will be simple as they are more interested in getting their data out there but then we&#8217;ll circle back around to address public-service-type applications after that.</p>

<p>Significant changes are coming for <a href="http://pub.obtusesoft.com">zigGIS</a>. Abe, Paolo and I have been laying out a roadmap for its way ahead. Look for an announcement soon via <a href="http://twitter.com/zigGIS">zigGIS on Twitter</a>.</p>

<p>I have been having a lot of fun with the REST-based APIs from ESRI (Javascript, Flex, Silverlight/WPF). In particular, I&#8217;ve been happy with how extensible they are in terms of being able to support new data sources.
<a href="http://openlayers.org/pipermail/users/2009-June/012414.html">OpenLayers 2.8</a> and <a href="http://blog.opengeo.org/2009/06/17/geoexplorer-preview/">GeoExplorer</a> are also on my radar but that radar screen is getting pretty crowded.</p>

<p>All of this with less than a week to go before vacation. Whew!</p>
