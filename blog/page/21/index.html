  <div class="entry-content"><p>This meme is percolating across the internets and it&#8217;s kinda fun.</p>

<blockquote>By definition then, the terrorists and their followers become excluded from civil society of the mainstream, while the sympathetic public remains included.</blockquote>


<p><em>The Geographical Dimensions of Terrorism</em>, edited by Susan L. Cutter, Douglas B. Richardson and Thomas J. Wilbanks.</p>

<p><strong>The instructions</strong>: Grab the nearest book. Open it to page 56. Find the fifth sentence. Post the text of the sentence in your journal along with these instructions. Don?t dig for your favorite book, the cool book, or the intellectual one: pick the CLOSEST.</p>

<p>If I hadn&#8217;t cleaned my desk on Friday, it would&#8217;ve most likely been something about Test-Driven Development but I did so this one was closest today which is interesting since it&#8217;s been ages since I read it. This particular excerpt comes from a passage describing the two primary audiences of terrorists and the social/physical separation of those audiences. It is taken from the section titled &#8220;Geographies of Inclusion/Exclusion&#8221; by Colin Flint.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In between proposals, white papers and the like, I?ve been able to do a little coding to keep myself sane. Recently, I have been playing with <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/sharpmap">SharpMap</a>, <a href="http://wiki.geojson.org/Main_Page">GeoJSON</a> and <a href="http://openlayers.org">OpenLayers</a>. But not necessarily in that order. Originally, I was looking over the GeoJSON spec to get more of a feel for it and decided that it would be fun (I know) to write an exporter for SharpMap. There is already a converter to write SharpMap geometries as WKT so I went ahead and built another one to convert to GeoJSON. In order to test it, I decided to use OpenLayers.</div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I use <a href="http://www.statcounter.com/">StatCounter</a> to track statistics on a couple of web sites, including this blog. StatCounter, like many other similar services, tracks by browser among other ways of analyzing your statisitics. Anyway, they have been <a href="http://blog.statcounter.com/2008/09/chrome-latest-stats-globalusuk/">posting some statistics about <a href="http://www.google.com/chrome">Google Chrome</a> on their blog</a>. I found them interesting so I thought I&#8217;d pass on a link.</p>

<p>What is most interesting to me is that, while Chrome usage has increased, it has not come at the expense of Internet Explorer. Primarily, Firefox and Safari have taken the biggest hit. In the US and UK, IE usage has actually grown since the Chrome introduction while the others have shrunk. Globally, IE usage also shrank but by less than Firefox and Safari. &#8220;Other&#8221; (I presume this to mean Opera and other cats and dogs) grew globally.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve played with Chrome. It&#8217;s nice as a curiosity. I think the world needs another browser about as much as it needs another lawyer but no one is asking me&#8230;.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.mapwindow.org/">MapWindow</a> is has posted a message over on <a href="http://www.linkedin.com">LinkedIn</a> looking for testers and programmers. The text of the message, posted by Paul Meems, is:</p>

<blockquote>Any GIS experts available with some free time?
Here at MapWindow GIS (<a href="http://www.mapwindow.org">www.mapwindow.org</a>) we&#8217;re looking for people who are willing the use MapWindow (it&#8217;s Open Source, so it&#8217;s free to use) and share their experiences. We also have our own LinkedIn group: <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/e/gis/122945/37A6504A848A">http://www.linkedin.com/e/gis/122945/37A6504A848A</a></blockquote>


<p>A follow-up answer to one of my LinkedIn contacts clarified that they are looking for testers and programmers. So, if you&#8217;re interested in helping out an open-source project, here&#8217;s your chance. Also, you may want to give LinkedIn a spin.</p>

For those who have been wondering about this (like me), I highly encourage checking this out. The SilverLight <a href="http://labs.live.com/Silverlight+2+Deep+Zoom.aspx">Deep Zoom</a> technology is pretty impressive and it works well in IE, FireFox and Safari (on Windows anyway). See below.</p>

It was a bit different for me since I was working <a href="http://www.zekiah.com">Zekiah&#8217;s</a> booth most of the time. I did, however, make it out to a SIG and a couple of technical workshops. Additionally, some of our technical staff were there and had feedback on the sessions. What follows is a very high-level summary of my week.</div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>My blogging has been slower this time around because I&#8217;ve been doing a lot of booth duty. This is my thrid conference this year and some of our other staff are getting to go to the sessions. I did, however, go to the SQL Server SIG a little while ago.</p>

<p>Ed Katibah had a few tricks up his sleeve. First off, he dropped the news that, as of 11:00am, SQL Server 2008 is now in RTM. Very soon, the final version will be in our hands. That&#8217;s great news to everyone who has been working with the CTPs and RCs.</p>

<p>Ed had few other nuggets. He described the stress-testing that SQL 2008 has undergone. In short, there has been about 375,000 hours of stress testing run against SQL 2008 so we should be able to expect it to be solid. Additionally, Microsoft has already been running on SQL 2008 for &#8220;a few months.&#8221; To me, this is all great news that makes me feel even more confident about the product (which already had my confidence). When I first installed the November CTP, I felt that much of the platform was already production-ready but more testing and use can&#8217;t have hurt.</p>

<p>Ed went on to describe the two spatial types and reationale for doing that. That discussion is well documented and I fall in the &#8220;it&#8217;s a good thing category&#8221; mainly because of previous work with applications that had over-the-horizon requirements.</p>

<p>Ed gave props to Paul Ramsey during his talk when explaining the XY switching debate. It was great to see that kind of respect on display.</p>

<p>Some nuts and bolts: SQL 2008 limits spatial objects to about 250 million vertices. This greatly exceeds Ed&#8217;s largest test case, which is a high-res vector data set of the world&#8217;s oceans. Polygons are limited to about 65,000 holes. I think those limits leave a lot of wiggle room. He also discussed the significance of coordinate ordering for the geography data type. Basically, it&#8217;s counter-clockwise for outer rings and clockwise for inner rings. This is consistent with implementations in Informix, DB2 and Oracle (those are what he mentioned). He did mention that this was an industry consensus but there was no official specification on this matter. Ed also mentioned it may be a topic of future discussion for OGC.</p>

<p>Ed also demonstrated the spatial results window in the SQL management Studio. This is a really nice tool that lets you visualize the results of your spatial SQL inside the management studio. As a developer, that will be a huge help because I won&#8217;t have to do a test run to see if I got the query right. Ed just saved me a bunch of time!</p>

<p>Ed went on to announce a companion CodePlex site for SQL Server 2008 spatial tools: <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/sqlspatialtools">www.codeplex.com/SqlSpatialTools</a>. There are already some tools that Isaac has posted but Ed said that other tools will include shapefile and KML converters. The site will also be open to contribs from the community. All of the tools currently there were developed using the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/isaac/archive/2008/05/30/our-upcoming-builder-api.aspx">Builder API</a> and full source code is available so they serve has great examples of working with the Builder API.</p>

<p>All in all, it was a great talk. Ed&#8217;s one of the nicest guys ever and he is having a lot of fun with ArcSDE on SQL Server 2008.</p>
