  <div class="entry-content"><p>I view <a href="http://www.esri.com/software/arcgis/arcsde/">ArcSDE</a> (and its predecessor, SDE) as something of a seminal technology. In my quest for true enterprise integration of GIS, ArcSDE <del datetime="2009-05-04T21:24:40+00:00">fills</del> filled a crucial gap by providing the ability to store, manage and analyze spatial data in the same <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_database_management_system">RDBMS</a> used for everything else. Long gone are the days when I had to manage relates between INFO tables or shapefiles and that&#8217;s a good thing. I have since accomplished similar tasks with <a href="http://postgis.refractions.net/">PostGIS</a> and <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technology/products/spatial/index.html">Oracle Spatial</a> but SDE was the first product I ever used that offered the capability to bring my GIS in from the cold.</p>

<p>At version 9.3, ArcSDE will support <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a> as a back-end, meaning you don&#8217;t <em>also</em> need to license an expensive RDBMS in addition to ArcGIS to take advantage of everything ArcGIS Server has to offer. This gives us another option and options are good.</p>

<p>I have blogged before about my involvment with <a href="http://code.google.com/p/ziggis/">zigGIS</a>, which has given me a lot of exposure to PostGIS. I&#8217;ve also done a good bit of work with Oracle Spatial. Both experiences have given me experience with, and a love of, spatial SQL (as each has implemented it). Having all of the data types and methods necessary to store, manage and analyze spatial data completely encapsulated in the RDBMS is a huge advantage. Building an n-tier or services-oriented system is so much easier because all I really need to interact with my spatial data is an OLEDB provider (we&#8217;re a .NET shop). This encapsulation serves to further expose the disadvantages of the current middleware approach of ArcSDE.</div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://apb.directionsmag.com/archives/3441-NPR-on-Withholding-Critical-Infrastructure-Data.html">This one</a> caught my eye when it came across Planet GS so I listened to the referenced piece.</p>

<p>Suffice it so say that I&#8217;ve been kind of close to this issue (more so in the past than I am now) and this kind of thing just really burns my arse.</p>

<p>I am less inclined to follow the line of logic that local officials are holding this data close as a means of accumulating power, although it certainly could lead to that. My experience is that most people are genuinely concerned about what they can do the keep their citizens safe while also providing good service.</p>

<p>Sean Gorman makes the dead-on point that geospatial data is proliferating rapidly and that it will overwhelm efforts to hold it back. It&#8217;s great that the town GIS staff doesn&#8217;t want to release manhole data but it&#8217;s really kind of moot when I can take a photo of them with my GPS-enabled phone.</p>

<p>The most salient point of the whole piece is made at the end when it is pointed out that there are no national guidelines in place governing the release of such information. Some areas make it available online. Others (like Greenwich, CT apparently) release nothing. This is exactly the kind of thing that DHS should be tackling but isn&#8217;t and hasn&#8217;t (and probably won&#8217;t). Apparently, six years isn&#8217;t enough.</p>

<p>As has been said about other issues, the people who want to do harm will find a way to get this information. Stances like that taken by Greenwich will only hamper law-abiding citizens with legitimate uses for the data. A structured process with appropriate checks in place will provide access to it in a way that minimizes (but never eliminates, because you can&#8217;t) risk.</p>

<p>Lacking any real guidance (and state, local and private infrastructure managers have been seeking guidance for years), the city of Greenwich can&#8217;t really be faulted. These are tough issues that don&#8217;t have easy solutions. Meanwhile, technology marches on. Maybe it&#8217;s time to get off the starting block.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I was researching the Google Earth COM API and came upon this little gem in its documentation regarding backward compatibility:</p>

<blockquote>Note About Backwards Compatibility

In all likelihood, future versions of the Google Earth COM API will be fully backwards compatible with the current version.</blockquote>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The same project that has me working with WPF has me busy on a few fronts. I&#8217;ve been spending the last few days writing a tool to export data out of an <a href="http://support.esri.com/index.cfm?fa=knowledgebase.gisDictionary.search&amp;searchTerm=ArcObjects">ArcObjects</a> feature class and dump it to a pgsql .sql file. <a href="http://www.esri.com/products.html">ArcGIS</a> acts as a serviceable generic data accessor to many vector data types and ArcCatalog provides a decent UI for the user community I&#8217;m targeting (also, they already have it). As a result, I&#8217;ve been developing an ArcCatalog command that exports a selected feature class.</p>

<p>As the title of this post suggests, I didn&#8217;t have a lot of time in which to accomplish this task.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&#8230;has (most likely) been greatly exaggerated.</p>

<p>I have no specific inside information but I do a lot of DoD work and I&#8217;m not seeing any massive shift away from ESRI. Sure, there&#8217;s been a few instances of Google Earth appliances and individual projects using open-source tools but there&#8217;s been no <a href="http://ubikcan.wordpress.com/2007/09/12/esri-cancels-its-books-loss-of-military-contracts-to-blaim/">dramatic sea-change that would drive ESRI to shutter its (unrelated) publishing business</a>. The whole thing seems a little shaky to me.</p>

<p>Just my 2 cents.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This probably old news but I&#8217;m pretty impressed by it. I&#8217;m referring to the recent visitor map on <a href="http://www.statcounter.com">StatCounter.com</a>. We do a lot of web development <a href="http://www.zekiah.com">where I work</a> (both GIS and not) and I like to keep an eye on tools that may be useful in that area. StatCounter provides a free service that keeps track of who&#8217;s visiting a site. It can track IP, referring links, etc. It&#8217;s pretty standard stuff but their reporting tools are nice so I thought I&#8217;d check it out.</p>

<p>Anyway, one feature they have that I didn&#8217;t know about when I signed up is a &#8220;recent visitor map&#8221; that places push-pins on Google Maps to identify where your visitors are coming from. Clearly it&#8217;s using some form of GeoIP and it&#8217;s not exact (no, I can&#8217;t find your house with it unless you live at your ISP). I instrumented my blog and it shows a good spread from all over the world. StatCounter has a javascript version and a version based on a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_bug">web bug</a>. Both can be mapped but the javascript version gives you more information, including things like referring links. My blog is hosted on <a href="http://wordpress.com">Wordpress.com</a> which doesn&#8217;t allow me to embed script tags in posts or widgets (ahem) but I instrumented another site with the javascript version and it works well. A screen capture of the map is below:</p>

<p><a href="http://geobabble.files.wordpress.com/2007/09/statcounter_geomusings.png" title="What? People don?t read my blog in Antarctica?"><img alt="What? People don?t read my blog in Antarctica?" src="http://geobabble.files.wordpress.com/2007/09/statcounter_geomusings.thumbnail.png" /></a></p>

<p>If you click on a push-pin you access information such as IP address, ISP, city/state/country, time spent on the page, OS, browser, referring page, etc. This has the potential to be a good, low-key business intelligence tool. You can see where your visitors are coming from and, with the javascript version, how they&#8217;re getting there. On the other web site, I have discovered that a lot of traffic is driven there via some of my ArcScripts posts, with a lesser degree coming from my blog. The biggest referrer tends to be Google and you can actually see the full query string so you can see the search terms.</p>

<p>As for the web bug version I set up on my blog, I&#8217;ve been able to figure out that a couple of big system integrators (who act as their own ISP) are interested in SharpMap.</p>

<p>I find this tool to be an ideal application of the push-pin mapping concept.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> Here&#8217;s another example showing some of the specific interest generated by the &#8221;<a href="http://geobabble.wordpress.com/2007/09/12/the-death-of-esri/">Death of ESRI</a>&#8221; post (the IP address and host name have been blurred to protect the innocent):</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It seems there&#8217;s been a little more buzz about <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/SharpMap">SharpMap</a> lately and some <a href="http://www.spatiallyadjusted.com/2007/08/21/how-popular-is-sharpmap/">folks have been doing some fact-checking with James offline</a>. He deftly spun the question of &#8220;viability&#8221; into &#8220;popularity&#8221; by citing <a href="http://www.codeplex.com">CodePlex</a> statistics. Can&#8217;t say I blame him. The question of viability when it comes to open-source, especially smaller projects, can be tough to quantify. Say what you want about <a href="http://www.esri.com">ESRI</a>&#8217;s licensing, tech support and whatever else; this much you can count on: they have genuine motives (profit, competiton) to keep their product line moving forward. The motives behind open-source can be a little more nebulous and they run the gamut.</div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Okay, I swear I&#8217;m not on the DDJ payroll, but <a href="http://www.ddj.com/web-development/201202675">this article</a> caught my eye immediately. <a href="http://www.swaine.com/">Michael Swaine</a> has been on a roll lately but I think this one just drips with significance for the GIS community.</p>

<p>Over the past 10 years, as everyone has run screaming from the desktop, I&#8217;ve been a little mystified as to why it was considered a good thing to reduce a <a href="http://www.computerpoweruser.com/Editorial/article.asp?article=articles/archive/c0612/28c12/28c12.asp&amp;guid=">CPU more powerful than everything NASA had in 1969</a> to a mere vehicle for a browser. The browser-based model reduced our computers to really cool-looking equivalents of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VT220">VT220</a> so it&#8217;s nice to see that the market is starting to gain back a little sanity.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A few weeks ago, I blogged about the <a href="http://geobabble.wordpress.com/2007/07/09/mo-no-mo/">end of the line for MapObjects</a>. I waxed nostalgic about how fun it was to develop with MO and how, although I haven&#8217;t used it in a while, I&#8217;ll still be sad to see it go.</p>

<p>Well, I&#8217;m glad I&#8217;m over that! I been working with <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/SharpMap">SharpMap</a> for the last few weeks and I&#8217;m feeling that old MO vibe again. It started a few weeks ago with developing a data provider for SQLite (<a href="http://geobabble.wordpress.com/2007/07/31/extending-sharpmap-with-sqlite/">read here</a>) but I&#8217;ve continued to look under the hood.</p>

<p>Lately, I&#8217;ve been working a project where we need to feed some spatial data into native <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/netframework/aa663326.aspx">WPF</a> display. WPF offers high performance and great graphics quality. In addition, there are numerous other types of data involved that also need to be displayed. We didn&#8217;t want dedicated display components for each type of data so we decided to bring the spatial data into WPF.</p>
