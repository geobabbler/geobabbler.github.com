  <div class="entry-content"><p>In the words of Pete Townshend (as sung by Roger Daltrey):</p>

<p>&#8220;Why should I care? Why should I care?&#8221;</p>

<p>I can&#8217;t answer that one for you. I ran into <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/israelio/archive/2005/09/11/424852.aspx">this post</a> while searching out something else. It shows how to get <a href="http://asp.net/">ASP.NET</a> running under <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/">Apache</a> on Windows. Curiosity got the better of me and I had to try it. One important note is that mod_aspdotnet is no longer maintained by the Apache Software Foundation. It&#8217;s now available as a <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/mod-aspdotnet">separate project on SourceForge</a>. If you download the latest version, it works with Apache 2.2.6.</p>

<p>Although both Apache and mod_aspdotnet have had subsequent releases since this has been posted, the instructions still work. It was about 10 minutes to get the sample project running and not much longer to get <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/SharpMap">SharpMap&#8217;s </a>&#8220;DemoWebSite&#8221; project working. Here&#8217;s a screen capture (there nothing that makes it obvious it&#8217;s running on Apache so You&#8217;ll just have to trust me).</p>

<p><a href="http://geobabble.files.wordpress.com/2008/01/sharpmap_apache.png" title="Can you see the real me? Can ya?"><img alt="Can you see the real me? Can ya?" src="http://geobabble.files.wordpress.com/2008/01/sharpmap_apache.thumbnail.png" /></a></p>

<p>This could be somewhat useful if you&#8217;re using a non-Server version of Windows and want to avoid the connection limitations of IIS. Beyond that, it&#8217;s probably just interesting.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So it&#8217;s been about a month since the release of the SQL Server 2008 November CTP. I&#8217;ve been dabbling with it and have made several posts about it. I still have a lot more digging to do with it but here are my impressions after a month:</div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>James <a href="http://www.spatiallyadjusted.com/2007/12/03/2008-esri-developer-summit/">posted</a> a couple of weeks ago about he Dev Summit. That got me curious, is anyone planning on going to the <a href="http://www.esri.com/events/feduc/index.html">Federal User Conference</a> in DC? It&#8217;s kind of mini East Coast UC. My company does a lot of federal and defense work so I&#8217;ll be there. It seems to be attracting more people each year in general but especially those from local governments around the region that don&#8217;t have travel budgets for San Diego. Rather ironic since it was originally targeted at federal users.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s actually something of an unusual year in that it looks like I&#8217;ll be at all of the big ESRI conferences this year (FedUC, BP/Dev, International UC).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Microsoft has <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/isaac/archive/2007/12/27/latitude-longitude-ordering.aspx">announced</a> that they will address this issue in an upcoming CTP. They plan to implement longitude-latitude ordering in WKB and WKT for both the geography and geometry types.</p>

<p>In a response to my <a href="http://geobabble.wordpress.com/2007/12/18/inserting-sql-2008-geometry-with-a-sqlcommand/">previous post</a>, <a href="http://www.spatialdatalogic.com/cs/blogs/brian_flood/default.aspx">Brian Flood</a> mentioned the ongoing discussion about <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/sql/2008/technologies/spatial.mspx">SQL Server 2008</a> and the &#8220;switching&#8221; of X and Y values in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-known_text">WKT</a> strings depending upon which spatial data type, geometry or geography, is being used. The SQL snippet below boils the issue down to a simple example:</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>

</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">DECLARE</span> <span class="o">@</span><span class="n">h</span> <span class="n">geography</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">SET</span> <span class="o">@</span><span class="n">h</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">geography</span><span class="p">::</span><span class="n">STGeomFromText</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;POINT(3 8)&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">4326</span><span class="p">);</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">SELECT</span> <span class="o">@</span><span class="n">h</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">Lat</span> <span class="k">as</span> <span class="n">geogLat</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>In both cases, the value returned is 3. As can be seen, the same WKT string is being used in both cases. The main difference is that one example queries the X value of a GEOMETRY object and the other queries the Lat (Latitude, or Y) value of a GEOGRAPHY object. So, depending on the data type, the same ordinal can be X or Y. You can check out the debate on this topic <a href="http://forums.microsoft.com/MSDN/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=2431933&amp;SiteID=1">here</a>. It is a great discussion that covers a lot of ground and I highly recommend checking it out.</p>

<p>For me, the issue is consistency. Regardless of the mindsets of professionals vs. non-professionals or the imprecision of the OGC spec, the bottom line is that the same call behaves differently for two related data types. Admittedly GEOGRAPHY and GEOMETRY do different things. GEOGRAPHY is for geodetic (spherical) data and GEOMETRY is for planar data. This fact, however, has no bearing on how WKT is parsed. The current situation is analagous to having a rounding function that by default rounds up for doubles and rounds down for singles.</p>

<p>At this point, I would normally say pick a method and run with it for both data types but I do have a preference here. I think that WKT should be parsed as X,Y consistently in order to provide better interoperability with a wider variety of client software. The simple fact is that most products out there do X,Y. For instance, I am working with SharpMap and it generates WKT in X,Y order and assumes X,Y order when parsing. Other database platforms such as Oracle, PostGIS and MySQL do the same but it&#8217;s the client software that matters most in this case. I&#8217;m sure that others can chime in with more examples.</p>

<p>I am intrigued by the use of a separate data type to handle geodetic data but the X,Y order of WKT has no bearing here. To my way of thinking, the best approach would be to commit to X,Y order for both GEOMETRY and GEOGRAPHY.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I found <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/07/12/Maps/default.aspx">this article</a> today about using <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/express/vb/default.aspx">VB9</a> and <a href="http://windowsclient.net/Default.aspx">WPF</a> to draw thematic maps. It&#8217;s a good walk-through of how to do it. The article admits that the coordinate transformation used is not terribly accurate but that can be rectified. This article is a good example of how to build a mapping application without any third-party components. The author converts Census boundary files to XML for this app. It shouldn&#8217;t be a stretch to use <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/sql/2008/technologies/spatial.mspx">SQL 2008</a>, <a href="http://postgis.refractions.net">PostGIS</a> or some other database that can emit GML and has an OLEDB provider as a data source.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been using WPF with <a href="http://codeplex.com/SharpMap">SharpMap</a> on a project <a href="http://geobabble.wordpress.com/2007/08/14/sharpmap-and-wpf/">for a while</a> but my mapping code is about 5% of the overall project and I haven&#8217;t had a chance to extract what I&#8217;ve done into something digestable to provide an example. I had to fit into the rendering paradigm of a previously developed GUI so it deviates from how it&#8217;s shaping up in SharpMap 2.0.</p>

<p>So, if you&#8217;re looking for an example of how to render spatial data in WPF, this is a good one.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><strong>Update (7/1/2011):</strong> I wrote this post early in the SQL 2008 CTP. I no longer use the method described here. If you found this post via StackOverflow or some other Q&amp;A site, I highly recommend this post by Vish as a more efficient way of doing things: <a href="http://viswaug.wordpress.com/2008/09/29/inserting-spatial-data-in-sql-server-2008/">http://viswaug.wordpress.com/2008/09/29/inserting-spatial-data-in-sql-server-2008/</a></p>

<p>I&#8217;m in the process of using <a href="http://codeplex.com/SharpMap">SharpMap</a> to write a utility to load spatial data into my <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/sql/2008/technologies/spatial.mspx">SQL Server 2008</a> instance. A couple of the SharpMap data providers have a static method to load data from a shapefile (really any other SharpMap data provider, but I digress). The method creates a table and uses an ADO.Net command object (<a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.data.sqlclient.sqlcommand.aspx">SqlCommand</a> in this case) load individual records into the table. I started using the existing <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/SharpMap/SourceControl/FileView.aspx?itemId=30508&amp;changeSetId=28971">MsSql provider</a> as a template, which load the geometry&#8217;s WKB into an image column.</p>

<p>The problem with SQL 2008 comes in when you add a parameter to the command. You must specify the data type of the parameter by passing it a <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.data.sqldbtype.aspx">SqlDbType</a> enumeration. Currently, there is no enumeration that corresponds to geometry (or geography for that matter). My first attempt was to leave the parameter defined as the type SqlDbType.VarBinary and set the value as such:</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='csharp'><span class='line'><span class="c1">//define parameter</span>

</span><span class='line'><span class="c1">//</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c1">//code in between omitted</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c1">//</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c1">//set value of parameter</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>In this case, feature.Geometry is of type SharpMap.Geometries.Geometry and AsBinary returns the <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/gis-wkb-format.html">WKB</a> representation of the shape. This code failed when attempting to execute the command, throwing an exception indicating that the table column (type geometry) was not a valid binary data type.</p>

<p>So I next tried defining the data type of the parameter as SqlDbType.Udt (user-defined type) and setting the UdtTypeName property to &#8220;geometry&#8221;. This failed also.</p>

<p>On a whim (I wish I could say it was something more scientific than a desire to leave no stone unturned), I then tried working with text and set it up this way:</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='csharp'><span class='line'><span class="c1">//define parameter</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="n">command</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">Parameters</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">Add</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;@shape&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">SqlDbType</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">NVarChar</span><span class="p">);</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c1">//</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c1">//code in between omitted</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c1">//</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c1">//set value of parameter</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="n">command</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">Parameters</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="s">&quot;@shape&quot;</span><span class="p">].</span><span class="n">Value</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="n">feature</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">Geometry</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">AsText</span><span class="p">();</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>In this case, AsText returns the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-known_text">WKT</a> representation of the shape. This worked! I have not dug into the details of why it worked but it seems the underlying spatial objects in SQL 2008 have some built-in default behaviours that coerce WKT. I am now loading data via a WinForms app with the aid of SharpMap. So, if you&#8217;re trying to update geometry from within your code, the above example is what worked for me.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll probably post the code to the data loader a little bit later after I incorporate SRID and geometry type constraints and the like.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A little clarification is in order:</p>

<p>SQL Server 2008 Books Online makes the following statement about SRIDs:</p>

<blockquote>
&#8220;A SQL Server-supported SRID for geography instances must be used when performing calculations or using methods with geography spatial data. The SRID must match one of the SRIDs displayed in the sys.spatial_reference_systems catalog view.&#8221;
</blockquote>


<p>As previously noted, SQL 2008 supports two spatial data types: geometry and geography. As can be seen, the above statement only applies to the geography data type. If you are using geometry, the SRID can be set to anything (I have done so). It would probably be a best practice to stick to <a href="http://www.epsg.org/">EPSG</a>-defined SRIDs but this does open up the possibility of user-defined spatial references similar to <a href="http://postgis.refractions.net">PostGIS</a>. <a href="http://forums.microsoft.com/MSDN/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=2505683&amp;SiteID=1">In a discussion with Isaac on the MSDN forum</a>, he clarified that they plan to leave such things to the discretion of the database designers/users for implementation. As can be seen in the discussion, it seems they may also write up some best practices but it seems many things such as constraints to limit SRIDs and geometry types will be left to users/developers/DBAs to implement.</p>

<p>So, as a result of the discussion, I think I have a better understanding of <a href="http://www.microsoft.com">MSFT</a>&#8217;s intent and how to proceed with SQL 2008. It will be interesting to adjust my way of thinking from what I have come to expect from other products.</p>

<p>Also, other discussions on the forum seem to indicate that this release will not have any coordinate transformation functions so those of us planning to use and develop with SQL 2008 should probably get comfortable with something like <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/ProjNET">Proj.Net</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://apb.directionsmag.com/archives/3703-Neogeography-is-not-GIS;-not-LI.html">All Points</a> got the ball rolling this time around. <a href="http://geothought.blogspot.com/2007/12/no-data-creation-in-neogeography-errr.html">Peter Batty</a> responded with his usual thoughtfulness and <a href="http://geotips.blogspot.com/2007/12/real-men-use-real-gis-software.html">Paul Ramsey</a> gets the award for the best reponse so far.</p>

<p>I watch this and can&#8217;t help but wonder: haven&#8217;t we been here before?</p>

<p>If we replace the phrase &#8221;<a href="http://gislounge.com/internet-mapping/google-maps/neogeography/">neogeography</a>&#8221; with the phrase &#8220;desktop mapping&#8221; then I feel like we had this conversation 10 (or more) years ago. The ironic part is that MapInfo was in the position then that neo-geo is in now.</p>

<p>Many GIS hard-liners argued that non-topological mapping packages could not be called GIS. &#8220;Real GIS&#8221; understood topology and could do analysis based upon topology. That argument was mostly forwarded by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ArcInfo">Arc/Info</a> crowd (although I don&#8217;t think <a href="http://www.esri.com">ESRI</a> was directly involved, it arose more from Arc/Info adherents). Software such as <a href="http://www.mapinfo.com/location/integration">MapInfo</a>, <a href="http://www.caliper.com/">Maptitude</a>, etc. was not &#8220;real GIS&#8221; and, therefore, their outputs could not be trusted.</p>

<p>Well, we see what happened: that market proliferated. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ArcView_3.x">ArcView 3.x</a> became the most widely used GIS package around at the time. Other desktop systems (MapInfo, <a href="http://www.manifold.net">Manifold</a>, etc.) beefed up their capabilities and ESRI eventually produced ArcMap. Anyone care to have that conversation again? I didn&#8217;t think so.</p>

<p>So, is neogeography GIS? I don&#8217;t know. What&#8217;s the measure? Those put forth by Mike Hickey are different than those put forth as arguments against desktop mapping years ago. So, really, the hurdle has just been moved. Maybe neo-geo isn&#8217;t GIS&#8230;yet. But does anyone really think the technology won&#8217;t advance? Take a look at <a href="http://featureserver.org/">FeatureServer</a>. Take a look at the various spatial SQL implementations in <a href="http://postgis.refractions.net">PostGIS</a>, <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/sql/2008/technologies/spatial.mspx">SQL Server 2008</a>, <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technology/products/spatial/index.html">Oracle</a> and many others. People are trying to solve that problem. If ESRI ever puts out their <a href="http://virtualearth4gov.spaces.live.com/Blog/cns!369B39F890CE30C1!408.entry">REST API</a>, the neo-geo community will have the full power (maybe) of ArcGIS Server at their disposal. I have an idea: if MapInfo feels that neo-geo isn&#8217;t really GIS, why don&#8217;t they create a product line targeted at giving the neo-geo community &#8220;real GIS&#8221; tools. Whatever those are. Looks like a market opportunity to me.</p>

<p>Making decisions about the viability/validity of neo-geo based on the current state of the technology is a little short-sighted to say the least.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It&#8217;s been a year since I stood up GeoMusings. This is my second attempt at blogging. My first, ArcDeveloper, fizzled mainly because of a lack of focus on my part. So I started again on 1 December of 2006. I was originally on Blogger but quickly moved to WordPress. Early on, I started playing with <a href="http://code.google.com/p/ziggis/">zigGIS</a>, the open-source <a href="http://postgis.refractions.net/">PostGIS</a> connector for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ArcMap">ArcMap</a>. I was impressed with the code and eventually joined the project. So the first couple of months were heavily focused on zigGIS and the blog may have been interpreted as a &#8220;zigGIS blog.&#8221; That was never the intent but have been the first impression.</p>

<p>Generally, the blog has been a way for me to vent about things I&#8217;m working with as well as an outlet for my own experimentation. It has been a great way for me to get exposed to the open-source GIS community. There&#8217;s a lot of impressive work going on in that area and it&#8217;s been interesting to see the pace with which open-source technology is advancing. I have also been able to meet some great people, such as <a href="http://www.paolocorti.net/public/wordpress/">Paolo</a> and <a href="http://abegillespie.blogspot.com">Abe</a> as well as many others. Anyway, here are some of the observations/opinions I&#8217;ve formed as a result of a year of blogging:</div>

BETHESDA, Md. - On two nights earlier this month, several cars were broken into in Bethesda, police said. The break-ins occurred overnight Nov. 7 to Nov. 8 and overnight Nov. 11 to Nov. 12, police said. Between the two nights, a total of 49 cars were broken into. 

The culprits stole global positioning systems.</em>
