  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have generally been very happy with <a href="http://www.gisintherockies.org/GISITR2010/Home/Default.aspx">GIS in the Rockies</a> (more on that in another post) as it&#8217;s good to get a look at different uses, concerns and perspectives. This afternoon, I sat through the &#8220;Collaboration Panel&#8221; discussion. The panel was made of of a few people representing state, regional and local governments and well as utilities and academia. Almost uniformly, there was a fear (yes, I mean fear) of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crowdsourcing">crowdsourcing</a> that was best summed up by the following statement:</p>

<blockquote> &#8220;Crowdsourcing presents a vulnerability to us.&#8221;</blockquote>


<p>Thank goodness <a href="http://twitter.com/gletham/status/24679715438">Glenn Letham was sitting there and tweeted it</a> or I might not have believed I heard it. Over the course of the discussion, talk kept returning to the image of &#8220;just anyone&#8221; editing spatial data, opening up potential liability for jurisdictions. Another gem:</p>

<blockquote>&#8220;When everyone is responsible, no one is responsible.&#8221;</blockquote>


<p>I will grant that the entire discussion did not focus on crowdsourcing but it was a topic that was circled back to several times. I was left with a sense that, when these people think of crowdsourcing, they literally picture crowds of the &#8220;great unwashed&#8221; making random edits to critical data sets from there iPhones. Fear, uncertainty and doubt was projected at such a level that it exposed, well, fear, uncertainty and doubt on the part of the panelists.</p>

<p>A great premium was placed on data being collected and managed by &#8220;authoritative&#8221; data providers, who collect data using a set of validated business rules and procedures. Yet a great premium was also placed on getting to the point where such data sets can be freely shared. This exposed to me another issue: a complete lack of understanding of the concept of crowdsourcing.</p>

<p>I realize that, for governments, there can be legal and statutory issues with publicly sharing data sets (the Privacy Act with regard to parcel data, for example) that must be worked through. For this discussion, I will set those aside. The following statement was made late in the session:</p>

<blockquote>&#8220;<a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/">OpenStreetMap</a> will never be an authoritative data source.&#8221;</blockquote>


<p>To that, I offer this (which I could not offer in the session since the floor was not opened):</p>

<p>If you feel you are the &#8220;authoritative&#8221; provider for street data for your region and that you capture that data using vetted procedures and business rules that assure data quality and accuracy <em>and</em> you profess to want to be able to share that data with the public, why don&#8217;t you donate that data to OpenStreetMap so that it would then be providing &#8220;authoritative&#8221; data (or at least data derived from an &#8220;authoritative&#8221; source). People who choose to use OSM for their applications would then be using high-quality data.</p>

<p>Why not, rather than tear down the concept, engage and participate, provide the model for how to do so and demonstrate leadership? In other words&#8230;</p>

<p>Be the crowd!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I mean <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wine">wine</a>, not <a href="http://www.winehq.org/">Wine</a>.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve got to give kudos for innovative marketing on this one. I found this interesting announcement from gvSIG in my inbox this morning:</p>

<blockquote>
Enosat, in collaboration with the Association gvSIG, is going to carry  
out an online course on Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and  
Remote Sensing applied to vine-growing for the English-speaking  
community.

This new edition of the course is launched in English, hoping to  
repeat the success of the previous edition in Spanish.

The GIS software used for this course is free software (gvSIG Desktop).

This course covers the basic concepts of GIS and Remote Sensing.  
Furthermore, it enables students to apply these concepts to their  
professional area. This course is aimed at the wine sector, that is,  
technicians in charge of wineries, vine growers, etc.

Places on the course are limited and the admission is in order of  
registration. The syllabus and course details can be found at  
<a href="http://www.enosat.com/formation.php">http://www.enosat.com/formation.php</a>
For further information, please contact: <a href="mailto:course.enosat@gmail.com">course.enosat@gmail.com</a>
</blockquote>


<p>I really hope this takes off as I am already envisioning a host of implementation services built around this market. Now I&#8217;ve just got to translate my rates into bottles per hour. ;-)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://twitter.com/mikehogan">Mike Hogan</a> tweeted that the Esri deprecation plan for ArcGIS 10.0 and 10.1 is now available. It can be found <a href="http://downloads2.esri.com/support/TechArticles/ArcGIS_10_and__101_Deprecation_Plan.pdf">here</a>. Much of what it contains is not new as Esri has been pretty good about getting information related to 10.x out. Some of the more interesting things (to me) include (comments in parens are mine):</p>

<blockquote>

ArcGIS Server 10.0 is the last release with support for 32-bit operating systems. The next release of ArcGIS Server (10.1) will run natively as a 64-bit application, requiring 64-bit operating systems. (I heard about the native 64-bit move at the Esri UC but I didn&#8217;t know that included dropping 32-bit. It&#8217;s not a big deal for me but I can imagine it&#8217;ll be an impact for many.)

ArcGIS Server 10.0 is the last release supporting publishing non-optimized map documents (MXD files). The next major release will only support publishing optimized maps (MSDs) as that is the best practice for map publishing. (There you have it, no more serving from MXDs after 10.0.)

ArcGIS Server 10.1 will be the last planned release for the ArcGIS Server Web ADFs (Application Developer Framework) for both Microsoft .NET and Java. (We had a small &#8220;wake&#8221; in San Diego for the ADFs. I won&#8217;t shed a tear when it&#8217;s &#8220;official.&#8221;)

ArcGIS Server 10.1 will no longer support local connections (DCOM connections) from Web ADF applications. ArcGIS Server 10.1 will be a web services (REST and SOAP) server only. (This is actually pretty major and the document details the impacts. <strong>If you have any ADF code doing editing and such, read this!</strong>)
</blockquote>


<p>There&#8217;s a lot of good information in the document, especially pertaining to ArcGIS Server so it&#8217;s definitely worth a read.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Paul Meems announced today that a new beta version of MapWindow is available. From the announcement:</p>

<blockquote>
We&#8217;ve just released the Beta Version of July.

It is available at <a href="http://svn.mapwindow.org/svnroot/InstallationProjects/4.8/Releases/MapWindowx86Full-v48Beta-installer.exe">http://svn.mapwindow.org/svnroot/InstallationProjects/4.8/Releases/MapWindowx86Full-v48Beta-installer.exe</a>

The supporting libraries (like GDAL, GEOS) have been updated to their latest versions.
A lot of new enhancements have been added to the ocx, like image grouping, image overviews (pyramids), symbology (charts and coloring), use of the rotation values in world files.
Not all new features made it yet to the Desktop, but we&#8217;re working on that.
The features are available to you for your plug-in or script development or when you develop a custom application using the ocx.
</blockquote>


<p>MapWindow is quite a powerful open-source (Mozilla Public License) mapping library for .NET. It&#8217;s under active development and seems to be adding capability rapidly. If you&#8217;re a developer looking for a library to add spatial capability to your application, you may want to check it out.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just got an e-mail announcement from <a href="http://www.arc2earth.com">Arc2Earth</a> (disclaimer: my <a href="http://www.zekiah.com">company</a> is a reseller) regarding some updates to version 3 that have come out since the ESRI UC. One of the updates that catches my attention is:</p>

<blockquote>
<strong>ArcGIS Server Tile Cache Format</strong> - You can now create or manage tile caches that can be used with ArcGIS Server. use Arc2Earth tile management tools (like the Change Detection Level) to dramatically reduce the time it takes to update tile caches

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Just a quick update on the <a href="http://www.geocommons.com">GeoCommons</a> importer for ArcMap <a href="http://geobabble.wordpress.com/2010/06/02/importing-data-from-geocommons-into-arcmap/">I blogged a while ago</a>:</p>

<p>There is now an ArcGIS 10.0 add-in available as a download from the Google Code site. It is available <a href="http://code.google.com/p/geocommonsbrowser/downloads/list">here</a>.</p>

<p>This should enable ArcGIS 10.0 users to also easily browse and get data from GeoCommons. Sorry, I don&#8217;t have the add-in code available yet. I&#8217;m a little swamped so it&#8217;ll be a while before I get to that but I wanted to make the download available.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I spent the vast majority of my time at the 2010 ESRI User Conference working the <a href="http://www.zekiah.com">Zekiah</a>/<a href="http://www.arc2earth.com">Arc2Earth </a>booth. That was fun as I got meet/reconnect with a lot of people but I didn&#8217;t see much of the conference itself. As a result, I haven&#8217;t really blogged it.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.esri.com">ESRI</a> continued with the &#8220;cloud ready&#8221; theme that was rolled out at the Federal User Conference but with more details about how they are moving to &#8220;the cloud.&#8221; This generated a lot of buzz amongst many of the attendees from what I could tell. One of the big new features of Arc2Earth v3 (disclaimer: my company is an Arc2Earth reseller) is Cloud Services. As a result, we had a banner in our booth that had the word &#8220;cloud&#8221; on it, prompting lots of people to stop.</div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have finalized my travel plans for San Diego to attend the ESRI User Conference this year. I will be spending most of my time on the exhibit floor working a booth. My company, <a href="http://www.zekiah.com">Zekiah Technologies</a>, became a <a href="http://www.zekiah.com/gsa">GSA reseller</a> for <a href="http://www.arc2earth.com">Arc2Earth</a> this year so Zekiah will have a joint booth with Arc2Earth.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll be there with Brian and Jack Flood and we&#8217;ll have the newly-released Arc2Earth v3 on display. Come by booth 632 to see A2E Cloud Services (using Google&#8217;s Cloud) in action as well as integration with <a href="http://www.arcgis.com/home/">ArcGIS.com</a> and a number of other features, including the new ability to export ArcGIS layer styles to <a href="http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/sld">SLD</a> (more on that in a future post). Don&#8217;t forget the free A2E Community Edition. If you won&#8217;t be at the UC, that&#8217;s a great way to check out what it can do.</p>
