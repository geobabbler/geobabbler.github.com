  <div class="entry-content"><p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Atanas&#8217; daughter, Christina, is now using his Twitter account to get information out. In addition, she posted a <a href="http://www.tenthcave.com/2011/10/plea-for-help.html">message from Atanas</a> on his blog. He and his son are currently being detained. Also, please see the comment stream to John&#8217;s post (link below) for additional information about sending letters of support.

<hr />


<p><a href="http://njgeo.org/2011/10/17/colleague-in-need-atanas-entchev/">John Reiser posted this piece</a> on the situation of our colleague, Atanas Entchev. Atanas, a native of Bulgaria, came to the United States in 1991, followed soon thereafter by his family. They applied for asylum and have been in litigation regarding their status ever since. The latest opinion, filed on June 23, 2011 by the US Third Circuit Court of Appeals <a href="http://www.ca3.uscourts.gov/opinarch/104369np.pdf">may be found here</a> (.pdf). Says John:</p>

<blockquote>
After emigrating here with his family over twenty years ago to escape political persecution, the US Government is now planning to deport the Entchevs.
</blockquote>


<p>My dealings with Atanas have been almost exclusively through social media channels and I have never met him in person. Despite that, I feel I know him as a result of his open participation in those arenas. His knowledge of the applications of GIS, especially at the municipal level, is top-notch. His contributions to the GIS community, such as the publications listed in his <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=8637855&amp;authType=name&amp;authToken=eUA1&amp;locale=en_US&amp;pvs=pp&amp;trk=ppro_viewmore">LinkedIn profile</a>, as well as his <a href="http://www.directionsmag.com/authors/atanas-entchev/121956">contributions to Directions Magazine</a> and his <a href="http://blog.entchev.com/">blog</a> demonstrate active engagement in his (our) professional community. He is also a small business owner, having founded <a href="http://entchev.com/index.htm">his own GIS services company</a> in 2005.</p>

<p>Of course, legal opinions are only meant to focus on relevant law. As a result, this tapestry of the Entchevs life in America becomes obscured. At one point, the opinion says (LPR = Legal Permanent Resident):</p>

<blockquote>
Although the daughter&#8217;s adjustment to LPR status may slightly strengthen Entchev&#8217;s ties to the community, and as a matter of discretion the Department of State may therefore be more inclined to grant a waiver, it is far from clear that the status of Entchev&#8217;s daughter as an LPR would result in a different outcome for a new waiver application.
</blockquote>


<p>Not being a lawyer, I can&#8217;t comment on the legal content but this is a very sterile reduction of the Entchevs&#8217; life. Those of us who have been linked to Atanas through social media know of his love of sailing, tennis and biking and have seen photos of the Entchevs enjoying the arts around the New York region. So, during two decades of litigation, the legal merits of which have left the Third Circuit Court of Appeals unmoved, the Entchevs have built a rich, textured, wholly American life.</p>

<p>As Atanas&#8217;s wife Mayia says:</p>

<blockquote>
If you are willing and able to write a letter of recommendation, your contribution will be invaluable to our case, and would be greatly appreciated by our family.
</blockquote>


<p>If you know Atanas, please take time to write a letter in support of him and his family. Instructions are in John&#8217;s post.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>One of the biggest sources of buzz at <a href="http://2011.foss4g.org/">FOSS4G</a> was <a href="http://cartodb.com">CartoDB</a>. It is a hosted solution from <a href="http://vizzuality.com/">Vizzuality</a> that uses <a href="http://postgis.org/">PostGIS</a> to allow you to store your spatial data online. I got a beta account a couple of weeks ago but life (i.e. paying work) kept getting in the way but I finally got to play with it recently.</p>

<p>One of the things that intrigued me is that, similar to <a href="http://www.google.com/fusiontables/Home/">Google Fusion Tables</a>, CartoDB exposes a SQL interface through a RESTful API (I&#8217;m still not sure if the term &#8220;API&#8221; applies to REST but it&#8217;s a convenient shorthand). Essentially, CartoDB exposes PostgreSQL SQL and the spatial SQL extensions of PostGIS. Once your data is loaded, you can query it and return the results as either CartoDB&#8217;s JSON syntax, KML or <a href="http://geojson.org">GeoJSON</a>.</p>

<p>With this information, I set out to build a simple application to query property data and display the results on a map in a browser. In addition to CartoDB, I elected to use the <a href="http://leaflet.cloudmade.com/">Leaflet</a> Javascript library to accomplish the mapping (although I also experimented with OpenLayers). Displaying and styling GeoJSON in Leaflet is very straightforward and this task gave me and excuse to get a little more comfortable with it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It was with great interest that I read <a href="http://greatergreaterwashington.org/post/12041/regional-map-data-is-expensive/">this post last week about the cost of GIS data in the Washington, DC region</a>. Not only is the post itself informative but the comment discussion is also a worthy read.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.netstate.com/states/symb/flags/md_flag.htm"><img alt="" class="aligncenter" height="256" src="http://www.netstate.com/states/symb/flags/images/md_fi.gif" title="Maryland state flag" width="384" /></a></p>

<p>This did get me curious, however, as to which counties in my home state of Maryland make GIS data freely available. The approach I took to this was simple: I did what any average county resident would probably do and went to each county&#8217;s web site looking for a link to a data download. If I didn&#8217;t find something in a few clicks, I went to Google (search term: {county name} md gis). If there was nothing there, I moved on. With that, here are the counties I found which provide free, downloadable GIS data:</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>If you are <strong><em><em>still</em></em></strong> using ArcGIS Online tiled services in WGS84, that other shoe you&#8217;ve been waiting for has finally dropped. The inexorable march of Web Mercator will apparently roll over ArcGIS Online around spring of 2012. From the e-mail that Esri sent today:</p>

<blockquote>This e-mail is to inform you that we are no longer updating GCS WGS84 services and will be retiring them as early as spring 2012. Before the WGS84 services are no longer available, we want to give you ample opportunity to migrate to the newer web Mercator services, if you haven?t done so already.</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://blogs.esri.com/Support/blogs/arcgisonline/archive/2010/06/30/arcgis-online-services-in-wgs84-deprecated.aspx">Esri has been telegraphing this one for a while</a> so there is no room for shock or outrage. If you are still using the WGS84 tiles in your application, you&#8217;ll just have to get past your preference for seeing Greenland in Gumbyvision.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I had the distinct pleasure of attending my first <a href="http://2011.foss4g.org">FOSS4G conference in Denver</a> last week. Having not attended one previously, I can only rely on the opinions of others that this has been the best FOSS4G yet. For me, this was best geospatial conference I have attended. I&#8217;ll probably blog in more detail about some of the things I saw but here are my high-level observations:</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m getting ready to head out to Denver for the 2011 installment of <a href="http://2011.foss4g.org">FOSS4G</a>. It seems like my biggest problem will be figuring out how to clone myself in order to sit in every session. Open-source geospatial is such a vibrant and active area right now that there&#8217;s just so much to see and learn.</p>

<p>A couple of things of note (to me) before I head out the door:</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In <a href="http://blog.geomusings.com/2011/08/30/prying-data-open/">my previous post</a>, I described how I used a Python script to scrape power outage information from a local web site and convert it into an RSS feed. In this post, I&#8217;ll show how I used GeoCommons to visualize the changing information over time.</p>

<p>The process starts by creating a data set in GeoCommmons based on a URL link to the feed created in the previous post. The general process for doing that can be found <a href="http://geocommons.com/help/User_Manual#Add-a-URL-Link-from-the-web">here</a> in the GeoCommons documentation.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In the aftermath of Hurricane Irene, I was trying to get information from my <a href="http://www.smeco.coop">local electric cooperative</a> about outages. There were many (including my neighborhood) and I wanted to see the scale of the problem. It turns out, they have a page with a map that shows current outages by zip code.</p>

<div style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://geobabble.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/smeco_outage.png"><img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-2018" height="202" src="http://geobabble.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/smeco_outage.png?w=300" title="smeco_outage" width="300" /></a><div style="text-align: center; font-size: 14px">Old school outage map<br /></div></div>


<p>It&#8217;s pretty old-school as far as web maps go but it gets the job done. Their day job is making electricity, not web maps, so I won&#8217;t critique it too much. One thing I did notice is that the map seems to be dynamically generated (as do the tables on the page) from some inaccessible data source. I search and tried to find some kind of feed, to no avail.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A couple of weeks ago, I took some gentle razzing from some quarters for admitting I still have a land line:</p>

<p>http://twitter.com/billdollins/status/102403900207935488</p>

<p>This tweet was the result of yet another dropped call, which is annoying, but the unreliability of cellular networks can be more than just annoying, especially given the fact that they are now the primary communications medium for many people.</p>

<p>Almost ten years ago, on September 11, 2001, I was being evacuated from the building I was in and was trying reach my wife via cell phone. I heard a few garbled words about my parents and our dog before the line went dead. The mobile phone network was down for quite a while and my old analog cell phone was a paperweight during that time. We met up at my parents house later and she had our son and dog with her.</p>

<p>I went on to spend the next several years closely involved with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_infrastructure">critical infrastructure</a> protection efforts and, specifically, the application of geospatial tools to those efforts. A lot of time, effort and money has been invested to make sure infrastructure works better in such situations.</p>
