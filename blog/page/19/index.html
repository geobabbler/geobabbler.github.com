  <div class="entry-content"><p>Just ahead of the <a href="http://www.gvsig.gva.es/eng/inicio-gvsig/">gvSIG</a> <a href="http://jornadas.gvsig.org/home/view?set_language=en">conference</a> in Valencia, <a href="http://www.gvsig.gva.es/eng/gvsig-desktop/all-versions/download/gvsig-19/downloading-the-program/">version 1.9</a> has been released. gvSIG is an open-source desktop GIS developed in Java. The new features in 1.9 are summarized <a href="http://www.gvsig.gva.es/eng/gvsig-desktop/all-versions/download/gvsig-19/version-notes/new-features/">here</a>.</p>

<p>Some of the new features, including SLD import/export, are pretty interesting. gvSIG seems to be flourishing a bit under the wing of <a href="http://www.osgeo.org/gvsig">OSGEO</a>. It&#8217;s a tool that I have gone back to periodically over the years, and I&#8217;ll probably take a deeper dive this time given some of the new features. I suggest giving gvSIG a go if you haven&#8217;t tried it.</p>

<p><img alt="gvSIG 1.9 released" src="http://www.gvsig.gva.es/uploads/pics/Logo-gvSIG_150_03.gif" /></p>

<p>UPDATE: The gvSIG download site seems to be having some serious bandwidth issues.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://donmeltz.com/blog/index.php/2009/10/25/gis-is-dead-long-live-gis/">Don Meltz</a> has kicked off the most recent round of discussion about the nature/state of ?GIS? (I put that in quotes since I am the one who declared it a myth). <a href="http://blogs.weogeo.com/jamesfee/2009/10/27/spatial-isn%E2%80%99t-special/">James</a> and <a href="http://blog.fortiusone.com/2009/10/27/the-once-and-future-map-the-destiny-of-gis/">Sean</a> also weighed with their thoughts on the subject. Like it or not, they are right. The technology that has for years been labeled as ?GIS? and segmented (somewhat artificially) from the rest of the IT industry is, with increasing speed, being integrated into the tapestry of mainstream IT. This trend is not only something that I think is irreversible and good, it is something that I have been actively working toward for my entire career.</div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This past weekend, NFL Sunday to be specific, I was the victim of a TV/internet outage due to a mistake made by a technician while they did some work at the junction box shared by my next-door neighbor and I. As a result, I was unable to watch my beloved <a href="http://www.redskins.com">Washington NFL franchise</a> hobble to another almost-loss so I had to find another way to keep tabs on the game. Since my internet service was also down, that left me with my BlackBerry Tour as my sole means of connectivity.</p>

<p>I initially started off on the ESPN site, trying to keep track of the action. Finding this unsatisfactory, I switched to MSNBC with the auto-refresh set to 30 seconds. I quickly realized that the information I was getting was woefully behind and quite inadequate. Then I had a different idea.</div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&#8220;The journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.&#8221; - Lao Tzu</p>

<p>One of my colleagues did a presentation at GIS in the Rockies 2009 regarding a project we?ve been working for a couple of months, the development of a GIS solution for the town of <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=green+mountain+falls&amp;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&amp;sspn=33.847644,79.013672&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=38.942187,-105.013332&amp;spn=0.064888,0.154324&amp;z=13&amp;iwloc=A">Green Mountain Falls, Colorado</a>. My colleague, Marshall Worthey, is also a resident and trustee of the town. Marshall is an ex-Army topo guy with a background in GIS. About a year ago, he told me about an upcoming project in which an Eagle Scout candidate was to collect the hiking trails around the town with a GPS. This was part of an effort he had undertaken to build a GIS capability that his town of 969 year-round residents could afford and maintain.</div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The <a href="http://www.mapwindow.org/">MapWindow</a> open-source project will be holding its <a href="http://www.mapwindow.org/conference/2010/index.php">first-ever user conference</a> from March 31 to April 2, 2010 in Orlando, Florida. Aside from being a great milestone for MapWindow, it is also being billed as a &#8220;coming out party&#8221; for MapWindow  6, its first native .NET version.</p>

<p>For those of you who are not familiar with MapWindow, it is and open-source (MPL 1.1) mapping library (think SharpMap or MapObjects) for use in developing applications, managed by the Geospatial Software Lab at Idaho State University. Although its desktop application and some geoprocessing tools have been written in .NET (VB.NET and C# respectively) for some time, the main library has been a 32-bit ActiveX control written in C++. At version 6, it will finally be fully .NET.</p>

<p>I had used MapWindow a little bit some years ago but haven&#8217;t recently due to its ActiveX structure. I will definitely add it to my (ever-growing) list of things to check out now that it&#8217;s been ported.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As I <a href="http://geobabble.wordpress.com/2009/06/30/5th-gvsig-conference-announced/">posted before</a>, the 5th <a href="http://www.gvsig.gva.es/index.php?id=gvsig&amp;L=2">gvSIG</a> conference is scheduled for December 2-4, 2009 in Valencia. I got an e-mail reminder that communication proposals (presentations, posters, etc.) are due by September 21st. From the e-mail:</p>

<blockquote>
We remind you that we are now expecting communication proposals for the 5th gvSIG Conference (Valencia, 2nd-4th December 2009) [1]. The deadline is September 21st.

You just have to send an abstract, following the template provided on the Reports section of the Conference web page [2] to contacto-jornadas-gvsig@gva.es and the scientific committee will evaluate it to be in the conference programme.

There are two types of communications: presentation and poster. The communications have to be preferably related to the gvSIG project and the following issues will be also be considered in the evaluation:

  * Innovation.
  * Usefulness for the GIS community.
  * Usefulness for the free open source community.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So the <a href="http://support.esri.com/index.cfm?fa=knowledgebase.documentation.viewDoc&amp;PID=17&amp;MetaID=1555">upcoming release</a> of ArcGIS 9.3.1 SP1 <a href="http://downloads2.esri.com/support/documentation/ao_/9.3.1_SP1_Announcement9_1.pdf">addresses a lot of issues</a>. I am somewhat curious why it&#8217;s not being called 9.3.2. Calling it a service pack seems to be mixing metaphors. Hopefully, ESRI will reconsider before it hits the street.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Back in the early 1990s, toward the end of the administration of George H. W. Bush and into the beginning of the Clinton administration, we were in a bit of a recession. It was not as bad as things are right now but, to someone who had just graduated from college, it was a tough environment. Even the US Government had a hiring freeze on. There was just no work to be had.</p>

<p>In the summer of 1993, I was bartender at the Chili&#8217;s in Waldorf, MD. I had about 8 years of restaurant experience and a freshly minted degree in Information Systems Management from the University of Maryland Baltimore County and very little else to recommend me in the face of so many college graduates and laid-off people with experience also looking for work.</p>

<p>One of our regulars was a guy named Mark. He wasn&#8217;t my regular so much as Ed&#8217;s, who was the senior bartender that I worked with on Fridays. He and his girlfriend (future wife)  would come in for dinner and have a beer or two while waiting for a table. Waldorf was much smaller then and Chili&#8217;s was really the only game in town at the time.</p>

<p>Mark would also come in maybe once or twice a week after work and have a beer or two during the week. It was during one of these visits that he told me about a contract his company had just gotten digitizing Army bases for the chemical weapons treaty. I mentioned my degree and expressed interest if he was hiring and, a few days later, sent him my resume. Until he got my resume, he didn&#8217;t know my last name and I didn&#8217;t know his.</p>

<p>Eventually, I landed that job working for Mark Quasius at Applied Ordnance Technology (AOT). It got me started in a field that I had heard mentioned once, in passing, during a lecture in college: geographic information systems. During that job, I got exposed to AutoCAD, MapInfo, ARC/INFO (6.something), and ArcView 2.0. I got to do some programming in AML, MapBasic and a little bit of Clipper. I met a lot of really good and patient people, did some cool stuff, made some mistakes, learned from it all and moved on after about three years.</p>

<p>During my time at AOT, Mark got assigned to the Crystal City office and we didn&#8217;t work directly together as much. After I left, I lost touch with him but usually heard when he changed jobs and heard that he was having health problems a few years back. Yesterday, I learned that Mark Quasius passed away on August 9, too young, at the age of 45 after a long battle with cancer. Here is his <a href="http://www.sheboyganpress.com/article/20090813/SHE010301/908130348/1067/SHE01">obituary</a>.</p>

<p>When I was leaving AOT, Mark told me the story of how I got that first job. Essentially, he had a big stack of resumes from applicants, many of whom looked stronger on paper. He felt he had something of an impression about me from our interactions at Chili&#8217;s and decided to take a chance on me. That decision earned him some quizzical looks from the owners but they left the decision up to him.</p>

<p>So Mark Quasius gave me my first &#8220;real job&#8221; in the summer of 1993 and set me off on a career that I didn&#8217;t expect. For that, I will always be grateful to him. At the risk of sounding cliche, he should have had more time. Goodbye, Mark and thank you.</p>
