  <div class="entry-content"><p>Most of the usual suspects were there today but there was very little that was new or exciting. The system integrator community was well represented as well as several relevant government agencies such as USGS, NGA, BLM, etc. There was a good cross-section of government support, including land managment, environment and others. In other words, it wasn&#8217;t as dominated by homeland security types as it has been in recent years. One thing that did impress me was the <a href="http://www.pbsj.com/what/Core/HDSurvey/index.asp">high-definition surveying</a> from <a href="http://www.pbsj.com">PBS&amp;J</a>. They had a sensor running and surveyed the exhibit hall pretty fast and they seem to be able to turn around good GIS and CAD data pretty fast. Beyond that, I had seen most of what was being exhibited before.</p>

<p>I continue to be impressed by the depth of the content of the paper sessions. I can honestly say that this is the first FedUC where I felt like I couldn&#8217;t get to everything I wanted to.</p>

<p>I want to focus a little more on some of the demos and also how ESRI is positioning the ArcGIS platform to support the &#8220;GeoWeb&#8221; implementation pattern. Jack identified four &#8220;implementation patterns&#8221; that defin typical GIS architectures. The first three are pretty standard: single user desktop, multi-user server, and &#8220;federated&#8221; (an ESB-type implementation). The last one is what he called the &#8220;GeoWeb&#8221;. That was depicted as a set of services (data, analysis and otherwise) that can be used by various types of clients included, desktop, web, globes, mobile and pretty much anything else. This is perhaps most effectively visualized as a &#8220;mashup&#8221; type of situation. This seems to intersect nicely with the realm of &#8220;neogeography&#8221; in concept.</div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This is my first time posting from my Moto Q so forgive any typos.</p>

<p>I just sat through the FedUC opening talk by Jack. There was a lot of talk about 9.3, as would be expected. There was also a lot of talk about positioning AGS support the GeoWeb, including a compelling demo of an AGS-based drive-time analysis in AGX, GE, VE and GMaps. More on that later.</p>

<p>Jack also mentioned some of the work being done to extend the geodatabase at 9.4. Not a whole lot was said about 9.4 (intentionally) except a little about beefed up 3D support in the geodatabase but he did mention the end of the year as a release target.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s the first concrete thing I had heard about a 9.x release beyond 9.3.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>At the risk of sounding like an ESRI shill&#8230;</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.esri.com/events/feduc/index.html">FedUC</a> starts on Wednesday and this year it seems to have a different feel to it. It feels like it&#8217;s definitely picked up some momentum over previous years. The sessions seem to be a little meatier and the atmosphere feels more purposeful and businesslike now.</p>

<p>I have been a proponent of the FedUC since it has started. First of all, I do a lot of work with ESRI products for the Federal government and the idea of having a major event (i.e. not a user group meeting) on the East Coast has been rather compelling. I&#8217;ve blogged a lot about the development I do but my company is small and I wear a lot of hats, including project manager, marketing, etc. ESRI&#8217;s federal team in Vienna, VA has put a lot of effort over the past few years into beefing up the FedUC, and it feels like that work is paying off this year.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve had numerous meeting requests this year. In addition, there are a number of sessions I want to see as well as exhibits by some companies that I have been wanting to see. From a business standpoint, there&#8217;s a lot of return on it this year (for me anyway). For those west of the Mississippi, you can probably get a lot of the same benefits in San Diego but those in the East (particularly those doing federal work) may want to give the FedUC a closer look. This will be the first year that I will probably spend each day there from beginning to end.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So my <a href="http://postgis.refractions.net/">PostGIS</a>/<a href="http://www.codeplex.com/SharpMap">SharpMap</a>/<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Presentation_Foundation">WPF </a>project is ready to go out the door. Literally. The servers are being loaded onto pallets and shipped to their respective destinations. Great! Time for a cold one! Well&#8230;&#8230;maybe not. There&#8217;s one little problem: there&#8217;s no data on the servers yet.</p>

<p>We had to coordinate with a large national government agency to get the data we needed. That part of the process experienced a little &#8220;slippage&#8221;. As a result, the last part of the task changed from loading data onto the servers to developing a data loading tool that could be run from a DVD with minimal involvement from humans. (Those pesky humans.) Just another Monday.</div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Installing the the SQL Server 2008 November CTP side-by-side with SQL Server 2005 is very straightforward. On the previous build of my machine, I had them both running just fine. After my system crash, I began setting things up again. Because I had been working with 2008 before the crash, I installed that first and then got around to 2005 later.</p>

<p>It should have been obvious to me before I did that but installing them in that order seems to break a lot of stuff in 2008. Kinda makes sense. I was a little flustered at having to rebuild in the first place and perhaps rushing things a bit but here it is for the record: If you are installing both of them on a new box, put on 2005 first.</p>

<p>Generally the database engine worked well. Most of the issues I had came up in the management studio. After installing 2005, many of the dialogs and property pages in the Katmai management studio would no longer display. Attempting to invoke them usually resulted in a &#8220;class not registered&#8221; exception.</p>

<p>In order to fix that, I had to remove and then re-install 2008. Before doing that, I detached my databases and then re-attached them after I was done. Everything works fine now.</p>

<p>This probably says more about me than it does SQL Server ;) but I thought I&#8217;d share.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Well, our abstract was accepted for the ESRI <a href="http://www.esri.com/events/feduc/index.html">Federal User Conference</a>. I say &#8220;our&#8221; because I am co-authoring with my friend/customer/former co-worker Dan Getman at <a href="http://www.ornl.gov/sci/gist/">Oak Ridge National Laboratory</a>. We&#8217;ll be presenting some work we&#8217;ve (Dan, me and a couple of other really good developers) done together on the <a href="http://www.sensornet.gov/">SensorNet</a> effort.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t want to spill the beans here but we&#8217;ll be presenting as part of the &#8220;Why Standards Matter&#8221; track. It&#8217;s been a fun project and we&#8217;ve gotten to do some cool integration. So, if you&#8217;re going to be at the FedUC, come on by and throw some vegetables at me (but try not to hit Dan, he&#8217;s a nice guy). ;)</p>
