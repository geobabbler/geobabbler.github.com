<p>One of the rangers working there told me it is to scale (although the quilt itself lacks any indication of scale).</p>

<p>The next two pictures are close-ups showing the north arrow and the use of buttons as place markers. The kids we are traveling with were fascinated by this map. You will notice a red box over a portion of the forest. That was the area covered by a relief map on a table elsewhere in the visitor center.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Shortly after ESRI announced the re-christening of ArcGIS 9.4 to ArcGIS 10.0, I posted <a href="http://geobabble.wordpress.com/2010/01/13/first-thoughts-on-arcgis-10-0/">this</a>. In that post, I expressed doubt as to whether it would really live up to major release status.</p>

<p>After having worked with ArcGIS 10 for a little while now, I feel it necessary to say that I was wrong. Due to the nature of recent projects, I have been experimenting mostly with Desktop. At the FedUC, it looked really impressive in demos up on the big screen but those were demos up on the big screen.</p>

<p>Working with the release candidate, I have found it to be impressively fast and stable with fairly modest hardware resources. Many processes seem to run in the background where they used to lock ArcMap and prevent you from working. Also, the updated UI is a breath of fresh air. These things, combined with many other improvements, have convinced me that the move up to 10.0 was justified, as it is obvious that major restructuring has occurred. I&#8217;m still digging into how it may affect some of my previously-existing code but there&#8217;s really nothing that scares me about that. I&#8217;ll blog about the code migration in future posts, I&#8217;m sure.</p>

<p>Given what I had previously posted, I felt it only fair to correct it based upon what I have observed. It looks like some good work from the folks in Redlands and I am looking forward to the full release.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><strong>Update:</strong> zigGIS has been discontinued.</p>

<p><a href="http://abegillespie.blogspot.com/2010/04/prodigal-extension.html">Abe officially announced</a> today that the next major release of <a href="http://pub.obtusesoft.com">zigGIS</a>, version 3.0, will return to open-source. This announcement was followed up with a message on the zigGIS Google Group. A snippet of that message is here:</p>

<blockquote>
We have some exciting news.  The next version of zigGIS will officially return to being truly open source.  That means zigGIS 3.0 will be free to download and use.

Of course this doesn&#8217;t mean zigGIS 3.0 will be free to develop. Though zigGIS is held near and dear to the hearts of the Obtuse Software team it cannot be developed on love alone.  So we we&#8217;ll be seeking funding in ways alternative to selling licenses.  We&#8217;ll follow a more traditional open source model of accepting personal donations and corporate sponsorships and selling support contracts.

Version 2.x will continue to be supported on the forums here and licenses sold at obtusesoft.com.  However, all funds will be applied directly to the development of 3.0.
</blockquote>


<p>I&#8217;m glad that zigGIS is returning to its open-source roots. Since the release of 2.0, the zigGIS user community has grown a lot and there has been interest from other developers in extending it in new ways. I am excited by the prospect of the involvement of a wider community of users and developers in its advancement.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Over the past few weeks, I have been reading a copy of the upcoming book by Regina Obe and Leo Hsu titled &#8221;<a href="http://manning.com/obe/">PostGIS In Action</a>.&#8221; Through my work with <a href="http://pub.obtusesoft.com">zigGIS</a> and some of my consulting work with <a href="http://www.zekiah.com">Zekiah</a>, I have been using <a href="http://postgis.refractions.net/">PostGIS</a> with good results for some time now. I have found that it matches or exceeds the capabilities of its commercial counterparts and I can be quite productive with it.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="http://www.manning.com/obe/obe_cover150.jpg" /></p>

<p>Regina has been a frequent contributor to zigGIS discussions over the years and her expertise with PostGIS has definitely helped <a href="http://dpulp.com/">Abe</a>, <a href="http://www.paolocorti.net/">Paolo</a> and I as we have worked on it. Also, many tips from the <a href="http://www.bostongis.com/">Boston GIS blog/site</a> have been very helpful so I have been looking forward to this book for some time.</div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The first <a href="http://www.somdgc.org/Default.aspx">Southern Maryland GiveCamp</a> is happening this weekend at <a href="http://www.smcm.edu/">St. Mary&#8217;s College of Maryland</a> in <a href="http://www.stmaryscity.org/">St. Mary&#8217;s City</a> for the benefit of <a href="http://www.somdgc.org/Request.aspx">19 local non-profits</a>. If you are unfamiliar with the concept of a GiveCamp, the web site sums it up but here is an excerpt:</p>

<blockquote>
GiveCamp is a weekend-long event where software developers, designers, and database administrators donate their time to create custom software for non-profit organizations. This custom software could be a new website for the nonprofit organization, or a small data-collection application to keep track of members. The only limitation is that the project should be scoped to be able to be completed in a weekend.
</blockquote>


<p>The Southern Maryland GiveCamp is being put together by <a href="http://jpendarvis.blogspot.com/">Jim Pendarvis</a>, who is putting an enormous amount of work into it. I had planned to participate but events have conspired to prevent that, although three of my <a href="http://www.zekiah.com">Zekiah</a> co-workers will be there.</p>

<p><strong>Jim still needs volunteers</strong>. If you are a developer in the Washington, DC area, I strongly encourage you to volunteer your time (<a href="http://www.somdgc.org/Tech.aspx">technical</a> and <a href="http://www.somdgc.org/NonTech.aspx">non-technical</a> volunteers are being sought). In addition to helping the community, you&#8217;ll also get the added benefit of spending the weekend in one of the <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;q=Saint+Marys+City,+St.+Mary's,+Maryland&amp;sll=-33.76676,150.774015&amp;sspn=0.039529,0.077162&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;cd=1&amp;geocode=FT6wRgIdJLRx-w&amp;split=0&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=Saint+Marys+City,+St.+Mary's,+Maryland&amp;ll=38.193942,-76.434288&amp;spn=0.074742,0.154324&amp;z=13&amp;iwloc=A">most beautiful locales in the region</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Several years ago, I took my family with me to the <a href="http://www.esri.com">ESRI</a> International User Conference and we spent a lot of time checking things out around San Diego. My son also participated in ?GIS Kids Camp? at the UC, where ESRI staff took kids through a few scenarios so they could do some simple analysis, data processing and mapping to get a feel for GIS. My son loved it and I think it was a good program that ESRI did a great job putting together.</div>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>A while back, I posted <a href="http://geobabble.wordpress.com/2008/01/07/sharpmap-on-apache/">this</a> about running <a href="http://sharpmap.codeplex.com">SharpMap</a> on <a href="http://www.apache.org/">Apache</a>. At the time, the ability to run ASP.NET on Apache was mainly a curiosity to me but had little practical value. Recently, I had the need to revisit this technique for a project. I used the same <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/israelio/archive/2005/09/11/424852.aspx">post</a> I had used previously as a reference, although the comment by Carlos there was more up-to-date and served me well this time.</p>

<p>This time, we were migrating an old custom-built site to the <a href="http://drupal.org/">Drupal</a> CMS. The old site was a mixture of ASP Classic and ASP.NET. Drupal is a <a href="http://www.php.net/">PHP</a>-based CMS. Due to the deadline for completing the migration, there were two ASP.NET applications that we planned to leave in place. They automated custom workflows and our schedule didn&#8217;t allow for rewriting them. Drupal had been installed as part of the <a href="http://acquia.com/downloads">Acquia stack installer</a> that includes Apache, PHP, Drupal and <a href="http://www.mysql.com/">MySQL</a>.</p>

<p>Following the instructions I had used previously, I integrated mod_aspdotnet in the Apache http.conf. I made the following entries, as instructed (these are sample entries for purposes of this post).</p>

<p> <code>AspNetMount /SampleASP "c:/SampleASP"
 Alias /SampleASP "c:/SampleASP"</code></p>

<p>These entries mount the ASP.NET application where it sits physically and alias it to a virtual directory in Apache. Having done this before, I was not worried. This time, however, it did not work. After some research, I realized that these directives were in conflict with some mod_rewrite entries that are part of the stack installer. They are:</p>

<p><code>
  ServerName localhost
  RewriteEngine On
  RewriteOptions Inherit
  RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !/acquia-drupal.<em>
  RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !/phpmyadmin.</em>
  RewriteRule ^(/.*)?$ /acquia-drupal$1
</code></p>

<p>In this case, any URI that does not look like http://${hostname}/acquia-drupal is rewritten to match that format. So my URI of http://${hostname}/SampleASP was being rewritten as http://${hostname}/acquia-drupal/SampleASP which does not exist and promptly fails. The solution to this problem was to modify the AspNetMount and Alias entries above to this:</p>

<p> <code>AspNetMount /acquia-drupal/SampleASP "c:/SampleASP"
 Alias /acquia-drupal/SampleASP "c:/SampleASP"</code></p>

<p> This redirected properly and the ASP.NET executed. So, the lesson here is that, if you choose to use a stack installer, make sure you understand the customizations that the installer makes to the products it includes.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><strong>Updated: </strong> This demo application now running <a href="http://demo.zekiah.com/weosilverlight">here</a>. I will update this demo periodically, as time permits, so keep checking back.</p>

<p>At the <a href="http://www.esri.com/events/feduc/index.html">2010 ESRI Federal User Conference</a>, <a href="http://www.weogeo.com">WeoGeo</a> announced the availability of <a href="http://blogs.weogeo.com/jamesfee/2010/02/16/introducing-weogeo-tools-for-arcgis/">a toolbar for interacting with WeoGeo Market and private libraries from within ArcMap</a>. This, combined with Dan Dye?s <a href="http://blogs.weogeo.com/dandye/2010/01/07/weogeo-api-python-examples-part-1/">series of posts</a> showing how to use the <a href="http://wiki.weogeo.com/index.php/Developer:_API">WeoGeo REST API</a> with Python got me thinking about how easy it would be to integrate with ESRI?s clients for the ArcGIS Server REST API. All of my clients (it seems) are using the <a href="http://resources.esri.com/arcgisserver/apis/silverlight/">Silverlight API</a> these days so I am spending a lot of time with it and decided to use it as my testbed.</p>

<p>My goal was simple, I wanted to browse the <a href="http://www.weogeo.com/market">WeoGeo Market</a> for any data sets in the current map extent, be able to select one from a list, and have its preview image display in the proper location on my Silverlight map.</div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m heading out this morning to the <a href="http://www.esri.com/events/feduc/index.html">FedUC</a>. Since it&#8217;s in my back yard, I usually hit it every year but, this year, I&#8217;m staying up in the city to save myself an even more hellish commute than usual. The lingering snow and ice has thrown roads in this area into mayhem.</p>

<p>Rumor has it that there are some <a href="http://www.spatiallyadjusted.com/2010/02/16/off-to-the-2010-esri-federal-user-conference/">West Coasters</a> making the trip for this one. It&#8217;s a good thing Ross scheduled the <a href="http://www.google.com/calendar/render?eid=ZDlpZTJka2l0NzNhdWJiYWRxYTVmdGQzbzQgdXA3ZHFqMWpxa2JsaDU3MXNwaHZhZnJuODRAZw&amp;sf=true&amp;output=xml">#geoglobaldomination</a> this time so they couldn&#8217;t use jet lag or time difference or some other excuse for missing it.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s definitely more of a buzz about the FedUC this year. I have personally spoken to many people locally who, due to the continued economic climate, are crossing San Diego off the list this year. It makes me start to wonder about whether the overall approach to these kinds of shows will start to shift to smaller, regional settings vice the single &#8220;big splash&#8221; event. Or maybe they should all just go virtual&#8230;</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re at the FedUC, maybe I&#8217;ll see you there!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I got a surprise e-mail from <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/site/users/view/FObermaier">Felix</a> today letting me know that the <a href="http://www.gaia-gis.it/spatialite/">SpatiaLite</a> <a href="http://geobabble.wordpress.com/2009/04/11/spatialite-provider-code-for-sharpmap-09/">provider I posted some time ago</a>, along with <a href="http://">Kev&#8217;s great spatial index work</a>, has been included in the <a href="http://sharpmap.codeplex.com">SharpMap</a> repository. If you&#8217;re looking for one place to pick them up, now you&#8217;ve got it.</p>

<p>If you haven&#8217;t checked out SharpMap or SpatiaLite, I highly recommend both.</p>
