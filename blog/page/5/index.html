  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve had a couple of people ask me recently about the geospatial tools I use. Year-over-year, that answer changes but here&#8217;s how I answer that right now:</p>

<p>As a Federal contractor, I spend a lot of time working with the <a href="http://www.esri.com" target="_blank">Esri</a> stack during my work day. A few years ago, I added a few open-source geospatial tools into my tool set and, since then, have also done a respectable amount to consulting work them as well. The balance between the two varies over time, depending on the requirements of individual customers and projects. Lately, commercial customers have seemed much more interested in open-source tools while my government customers are sticking with Esri. Since those observations are based on the the extremely heavy filter of my own recent experience, I&#8217;d be hesitant to draw any larger conclusions from them.</p>

<p><img alt="" height="264" src="/images/posts/duct-tape.jpg" title="Duct Tape" width="300" /></p>

<p>I&#8217;ve always believed that proficiency with a wide range of tools makes me a better consultant and integrator, so I am always exploring and trying new things. With those commercial customers, and in my own personal side projects, my recent workflows have gelled around a core set of tools, both commercial and open-source: </div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In celebration of this day when the non-stop political ads, robo-calls, junk mail, and social media posts <em>should</em> finally come to an end. I threw together a little map to show the latest time at which polls close in each state. This should represent, state-by-state, the time (EST) at which you can safely go back to answering your phones. Click the image below to go there (the data takes a couple of seconds to load).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>One of the most compelling recent success stories for open-source geospatial tools in the Federal Government has been the <a href="http://www.fcc.gov/" target="_blank">Federal Communications Commission</a> (FCC) <a href="http://broadbandmap.gov/" target="_blank">National Broadband Map</a> initiative. It has been a very visible example of the stability, scalability, flexibility, and power of open-source geospatial tools.</p>

<p>The Woodrow Wilson Center will be hosting <a href="http://www.wilsoncenter.org/event/the-national-broadband-map-case-study-open-innovation-for-national-policy" target="_blank">a case study of National Broadband Map</a> on October 15th, 2012. The event&#8217;s page also includes a link to the full paper (PDF), authored by <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=113470334" target="_blank">Zachary Bastian</a> of the Wilson Center and <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=10690378" target="_blank">Michael Byrne</a> of the FCC.</p>

<p><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2933" height="285" src="http://geobabble.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/nbm.png" title="nbm" width="640" /></p>

<p>The full paper, in my opinion, is recommended reading for anyone working with geospatial technologies in the government space. While the Broadband Map has rightfully garnered significant attention based upon its success, especially in terms of performance and scalability, the paper does a good job of reminding us that the map is not an end goal in itself, but a step toward the larger policy goal of expanding broadband access. The paper does an excellent job of illustrating how top-level policy goals were broken down into actionable parts that resulted in a concrete product such as the Broadband Map. In so doing, it walks us through the introduction and fostering of an open culture within the FCC that resulted not only in the Broadband Map but also in the development of open APIs and the availability of FCC tools as open-source projects themselves.</p>

<p>In its conclusions, the paper also makes compelling observations about the power of focused policy goals to drive the use of technology standing in stark contrast to generic overarching technical policies, such as the National Spatial Data Infrastructure (NSDI) which are disconnected from specific policy goals and achieve little traction.</p>

<p>If you are interested not only in geospatial technologies, but also the link between policy and technology implementation, and the cultural change that can be brought about by open-source technologies, you should consider attending the event at the Wilson Center on the 15th. While not a universal blueprint, the National Broadband Map makes a compelling case study.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There&#8217;s been a lot of talk about <a href="http://mapbox.com/tilemill/" target="_blank">TileMill</a> and <a href="http://mapbox.com/tilemill/docs/manual/carto/" target="_blank">CartoCSS</a> lately, with good cause. TileMill makes it very easy generate beautiful map tiles using the <a href="http://mapnik.org/" target="_blank">Mapnik</a> engine and CartoCSS provides a familiar method to author the cartographic representation of spatial data. <a href="http://mapbrief.com/2012/09/27/gis-cartography-the-latest-best-opportunity-to-bridge-the-chasm/" target="_blank">As Brian Timoney points out</a>, CartoCSS has the added bonus of making best practices shareable via copy-and-paste.</p>




<p>Naturally, the best way to take advantage of TileMill is to export your tiles to <a href="https://github.com/mapbox/mbtiles-spec" target="_blank">MBTiles</a> and use <a href="http://mapbox.com/" target="_blank">MapBox</a> hosting. If that&#8217;s not an option, you can pretty easily self-host with <a href="https://github.com/mapbox/tilestream" target="_blank">TileStream</a>. That said, there are some organizations that, due to larger GIS workflows, IT policies, and a host of other legitimate reasons, need or choose to use <a href="http://www.esri.com" target="_blank">ArcGIS Server</a> to do map hosting. For those organizations, TileMill is still an option to create attractive basemaps, within certain constraints.</p>


<p><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2911" height="295" src="http://geobabble.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/tilemill_screen.png" title="tilemill_screen" width="640" /></p>

<p>So I set out to see if I could bridge the gap between the two. Two blog posts pointed the way. A while back, <a href="http://www.weogeo.com/blog/Create_WeoGeo_Tilepack_from_MBTiles_SQLite_database_with_mbutil.html" target="_blank">Dan Dye blogged about how he had forked mb-util</a> and added support for exporting WeoGeo tilepacks from MBTiles. Also, a co-worker of mine, Eric Mahaffey, had blogged some time ago about <a href="http://www.zekiah.com/index.php?q=blog/2011/08/03/using-arc2earth-tile-caching-across-air-gapped-networks" target="_blank">how to use Arc2Earth to manage tile caches across air-gapped networks</a>. Using these posts for guidance, I was pretty sure I had all the pieces I needed. </div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So I&#8217;ve actually noticed a surprising uptick in traffic related to <a href="https://code.google.com/p/ziggis/" target="_blank">zigGIS</a> lately? We also had someone asking about <a href="http://www.st-links.com/Pages/default.aspx" target="_blank">ST-Links</a> on the zigGIS mailing list last week. Clearly, there&#8217;s still a level of interest out there for the problem that zigGIS was designed for.</p>

<div style="font-size: 70%;"><strong>ArcGIS reading SpatiaLite natively, thanks to OGR and Ragi Burhum</strong></div>


<br />


<p>Along those lines, <a href="http://twitter.com/rburhum" target="_blank">Ragi Burhum</a> posted an <a href="https://github.com/RBURHUM/arcgis-ogr/" target="_blank">OGR Workspace plug-in for ArcGIS</a> up on GitHub. Using OGR is really the magic ticket and the project is available under a BSD license (which Ragi explains very well). The only word to the wise is that pre-built binaries and installers aren&#8217;t available yet so you Windows/<a href="http://www.esri.com" target="_blank">ArcGIS</a> users will need to get your hands dirty.</p>

<p>I haven&#8217;t used it yet but I plan to within the next week or so. Stay tuned for a follow up post.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So the data server that I was working with was having issues and, while waiting for the IT staff to resolve things, I decided to browse the <a href="http://gis.stackexchange.com/" target="_blank">GIS StackExchange</a> site. It&#8217;s been online for quite sometime now, though I am only an occasional user. One thing led to another and I found myself playing with the <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2012/09/stack-exchange-api-v2-1/" target="_blank">StackExchange API</a>, which returns various information for a particular site in a JSON format.</p>

<p><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2871" height="328" src="http://geobabble.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/gis_se_crop.png?w=1024" title="gis_se_crop" width="1024" /></p>

<p>One of the things that got people excited about the site was that it was neutral territory, not directly controlled by a particular vendor or organization and it remains one of the few places where you can see hyperbole-free discussion of Esri tools right next to that of open-source tools and general GIS concepts. Since it&#8217;s been online for a while now, it has a lot of posts covering many different topics. I had some time on my hands, so I decided to pull the information for the 100 most &#8220;popular&#8221; tags, using the StackExchange API. With JSON in hand, I parsed into a CSV with Python and loaded the data into Excel to take a look.  </div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So I&#8217;ve been playing with <a href="http://leaflet.cloudmade.com/" target="_blank">Leaflet</a> a lot lately. It&#8217;s become my lightweight mapping library of choice. There&#8217;s a lot it doesn&#8217;t do so I keep <a href="http://www.openlayers.org/" target="_blank">OpenLayers</a> and others in the rotation as well but Leaflet is direct and to the point so I use it when I can.</p>

<div style="text-align:center;"><a href="/assets/demos/clustermap/"><img alt="" class="size-full wp-image-2848" height="291" src="http://geobabble.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/gisp_cluster.png" title="Cluster Map of US GISPs" width="640" /></a><div style="text-align:center;font-size: 14px;">Click the image to go to the live demo<br/><br/></div></div>


<p>A while back, I stumbled onto the <a href="https://github.com/danzel/Leaflet.markercluster" target="_blank">Leaflet.markercluster</a> project on GitHub, which adds a clustering layer type. I wanted to try it so I revisited my old <a href="http://blog.geomusings.com/2011/02/02/mapping-gisp-and-pmp-certifications-with-geocommons-and-the-esri-silverlight-api/" target="_blank">GISP heat map demo</a> (Silverlight) and decided to rework it. I was happy to finally get a chance to strip out the plug-in, anyway.  </div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In support of some of our ongoing <a href="http://www.zekiah.com/index.php?q=blog/topics/pim" target="_blank">PIM</a> work, we&#8217;ve been integrating the <a href="http://www.esri.com" target="_blank">Esri</a> <a href="http://resources.arcgis.com/content/geodatabases/10.0/file-gdb-api" target="_blank">File Geodatabase (FGDB) API</a> into some tools. Without going into a level of detail that would hijack this post, one of the many functions performed by some of the tools is to validate physical spatial databases against established data models to analyze compliance and identify differences. These databases may be in Esri or non-Esri formats and we have traditionally handled Esri geodatabases through ArcObjects since it provides a relatively uniform interface across the various flavors of geodatabase.</p>

<p><img alt="" style="text-align: center;" height="300" src="http://geobabble.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/fileapi2.png" title="FGDB API" width="287" /></p>

<p>Of course, ArcObjects requires an ArcGIS license of some sort and we are finding out that this is not always available to users in the field under many situations so the FGDB API gets past that for file geodatabases, at least. </div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I was mowing the lawn today and trimming with the push mower pictured below. If it looks old, that&#8217;s because it is. I first acquired it in 1978 when it was given to me by neighbors that were moving to an apartment near the city, meaning they no longer needed it. It still starts on the third pull and I&#8217;ve used it every summer since it was given to me.</p>

<p><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2823" height="360" src="http://geobabble.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/mower.jpeg" title="They don&#039;t make them like this anymore" width="640" /></p>

<p>As I was mowing, I thought about how old the mower is and how it came to be in my possession. This led me to think about the origin of my fascination with maps. What does one have to do with the other? Allow me to explain.</p>

<p>As you can imagine, I was fairly young when the lawn mower was given to me. I had gotten to know the neighbors up the street by playing with their son. One day, I noticed a large shelf of identical, leather-bound books taking up the entire back wall of a room. I asked what they were and they invited me to browse them. It turned out that my neighbor was the son of a long-time chair of the National Geographic Society. These books were actually bound collections, by year, of every issue of National Geographic from the first issue on.</p>

<p>Over time, I would spend hours poring through these volumes, fascinated by the world as it was documented by National Geographic from 1888 forward. I did not get to read every issue but I was especially drawn to the maps when they were present. I realize now that my identity as a &#8220;map nerd&#8221; took root there.</p>

<p>Coincidentally, 1978 was the year I first started programming. Those two experiences turned out to be major influences on who I became.</p>
