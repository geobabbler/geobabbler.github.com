  <div class="entry-content"><p>If you?ve been to the <a href="http://pub.obtusesoft.com">Obtuse Software</a> site recently, you may or may not have noticed a change to the ?<a href="http://pub.obtusesoft.com/who.aspx">Who We Are</a>? page. It now lists only <a href="http://abegillespie.blogspot.com">Abe Gillespie</a> and <a href="http://www.paolocorti.net/">Paolo Corti</a>. Prior to my trip to Colorado to talk about zigGIS at <a href="http://www.gisintherockies.org/GISITR2010/Home/Default.aspx">GIS in the Rockies</a>, I informed Abe and Paolo that I would be stepping back from any ?official? involvement in Obtuse.</p>

<p>This does not mean that I am stepping back from involvement in zigGIS. I plan to continue to support zigGIS as it returns to open-source but, in truth, I haven?t done much with zigGIS day-to-day in a long time. As part of the <a href="http://abegillespie.blogspot.com/2010/04/prodigal-extension.html">return of zigGIS to open-source at version 3.0</a>, Abe has been working on a plan to give the community multiple paths to support the project, including sponsorship and technical support plans. I&#8217;m sure he&#8217;ll have the details out soon so I&#8217;ll leave it at that (since it&#8217;s not my story to tell). So, as Obtuse transitions to more of a supporting role for the zigGIS 3.0 open-source project, I felt that this was a good time to step away and become part of the community. </div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Last week marked a couple of firsts for me: it was my first time attending the <a href="http://www.gisintherockies.org/GISITR2010/Home/Default.aspx">GIS in the Rockies</a> conference and also my first time in Northern Colorado. I enjoyed my trip greatly.</p>

<p>First off, the people of Northern Colorado were universally nice. That held true of everyone I met at the conference as well as people at every restaurant, gas station and other establishment I entered. Of course, why not? The countryside is beautiful. For a lifelong resident of the East Coast, the countryside of Northern Colorado represents the stereotypical image I get in my mind when I think of &#8220;the West.&#8221; Driving north from Denver, the plains stretched out on one side as far as I could see while, on the other side, mountains arose as if just &#8220;plopped&#8221; there. All of this under a sky so vast I have really only seen its like back East when driving through the Everglades.</p>

<p>In this setting, I made my way to the conference. This is the first time I&#8217;ve been to such a regional conference. Due to committments at home, I had to fly out Wednesday morning so I did not get to catch <a href="http://twitter.com/pmbatty">Peter Batty&#8217;s</a> <a href="http://www.gisuser.com/content/view/21412/28/">keynote</a>. I did, however, run into <a href="http://twitter.com/briantimoney">Brian Timoney</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/gletham">Glenn Letham</a> rather quickly so I started out with friendly faces. </div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have generally been very happy with <a href="http://www.gisintherockies.org/GISITR2010/Home/Default.aspx">GIS in the Rockies</a> (more on that in another post) as it&#8217;s good to get a look at different uses, concerns and perspectives. This afternoon, I sat through the &#8220;Collaboration Panel&#8221; discussion. The panel was made of of a few people representing state, regional and local governments and well as utilities and academia. Almost uniformly, there was a fear (yes, I mean fear) of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crowdsourcing">crowdsourcing</a> that was best summed up by the following statement:</p>

<blockquote> &#8220;Crowdsourcing presents a vulnerability to us.&#8221;</blockquote>


<p>Thank goodness <a href="http://twitter.com/gletham/status/24679715438">Glenn Letham was sitting there and tweeted it</a> or I might not have believed I heard it. Over the course of the discussion, talk kept returning to the image of &#8220;just anyone&#8221; editing spatial data, opening up potential liability for jurisdictions. Another gem:</p>

<blockquote>&#8220;When everyone is responsible, no one is responsible.&#8221;</blockquote>


<p>I will grant that the entire discussion did not focus on crowdsourcing but it was a topic that was circled back to several times. I was left with a sense that, when these people think of crowdsourcing, they literally picture crowds of the &#8220;great unwashed&#8221; making random edits to critical data sets from there iPhones. Fear, uncertainty and doubt was projected at such a level that it exposed, well, fear, uncertainty and doubt on the part of the panelists.</p>

<p>A great premium was placed on data being collected and managed by &#8220;authoritative&#8221; data providers, who collect data using a set of validated business rules and procedures. Yet a great premium was also placed on getting to the point where such data sets can be freely shared. This exposed to me another issue: a complete lack of understanding of the concept of crowdsourcing.</p>

<p>I realize that, for governments, there can be legal and statutory issues with publicly sharing data sets (the Privacy Act with regard to parcel data, for example) that must be worked through. For this discussion, I will set those aside. The following statement was made late in the session:</p>

<blockquote>&#8220;<a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/">OpenStreetMap</a> will never be an authoritative data source.&#8221;</blockquote>


<p>To that, I offer this (which I could not offer in the session since the floor was not opened):</p>

<p>If you feel you are the &#8220;authoritative&#8221; provider for street data for your region and that you capture that data using vetted procedures and business rules that assure data quality and accuracy <em>and</em> you profess to want to be able to share that data with the public, why don&#8217;t you donate that data to OpenStreetMap so that it would then be providing &#8220;authoritative&#8221; data (or at least data derived from an &#8220;authoritative&#8221; source). People who choose to use OSM for their applications would then be using high-quality data.</p>

<p>Why not, rather than tear down the concept, engage and participate, provide the model for how to do so and demonstrate leadership? In other words&#8230;</p>

<p>Be the crowd!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I finally got around to finishing my travel plans for <a href="http://www.gisintherockies.org/GISITR2010/Home/Default.aspx">GIS in the Rockies</a> (personal obligations prevent me from making it out for <a href="http://ignitespatialnoco.wordpress.com/">Ingite Spatial NoCo</a>). I booked my flight a while ago but I had been procrastinating on the hotel and rental car. This will be my first time in that part of Colorado so I am looking forward to seeing the area and meeting people out there. NoCo is second only to the DC area in clustering of folks in my Twitter crowd.</div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I am seeing a bit of a bump in traffic from the &#8221;<a href="http://www.onlineengineeringdegree.org/50-best-blogs-for-geography-geeks">50 Best Blogs for Geography Geeks</a>&#8221; list that hit the interwebs yesterday. I don&#8217;t usually pay much attention to such lists but I do recognize that they can be useful &#8220;one-stop&#8221; resources for people who are just getting started with geospatial tools. That said, this list caught my attention more for some of the blogs that were not included than for those that were.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/img/09-07/0908sign.jpg" /></p>

<p>If you are here because my blog was listed there (the list was also blogged by <a href="http://mapperz.blogspot.com/2010/09/50-best-blogs-for-geography-geeks.html">Mapperz</a>), here are a few notable geospatially-oriented blogs that I was surprised to find omitted from that list. These are blogs I consider resources and inspirations for my work/explorations/musings. I strongly recommend checking them out. They are listed in no particular order.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I mean <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wine">wine</a>, not <a href="http://www.winehq.org/">Wine</a>.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve got to give kudos for innovative marketing on this one. I found this interesting announcement from gvSIG in my inbox this morning:</p>

<blockquote>
Enosat, in collaboration with the Association gvSIG, is going to carry  
out an online course on Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and  
Remote Sensing applied to vine-growing for the English-speaking  
community.

This new edition of the course is launched in English, hoping to  
repeat the success of the previous edition in Spanish.

The GIS software used for this course is free software (gvSIG Desktop).

This course covers the basic concepts of GIS and Remote Sensing.  
Furthermore, it enables students to apply these concepts to their  
professional area. This course is aimed at the wine sector, that is,  
technicians in charge of wineries, vine growers, etc.

Places on the course are limited and the admission is in order of  
registration. The syllabus and course details can be found at  
<a href="http://www.enosat.com/formation.php">http://www.enosat.com/formation.php</a>
For further information, please contact: <a href="mailto:course.enosat@gmail.com">course.enosat@gmail.com</a>
</blockquote>


<p>I really hope this takes off as I am already envisioning a host of implementation services built around this market. Now I&#8217;ve just got to translate my rates into bottles per hour. ;-)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://twitter.com/mikehogan">Mike Hogan</a> tweeted that the Esri deprecation plan for ArcGIS 10.0 and 10.1 is now available. It can be found <a href="http://downloads2.esri.com/support/TechArticles/ArcGIS_10_and__101_Deprecation_Plan.pdf">here</a>. Much of what it contains is not new as Esri has been pretty good about getting information related to 10.x out. Some of the more interesting things (to me) include (comments in parens are mine):</p>

<blockquote>

ArcGIS Server 10.0 is the last release with support for 32-bit operating systems. The next release of ArcGIS Server (10.1) will run natively as a 64-bit application, requiring 64-bit operating systems. (I heard about the native 64-bit move at the Esri UC but I didn&#8217;t know that included dropping 32-bit. It&#8217;s not a big deal for me but I can imagine it&#8217;ll be an impact for many.)

ArcGIS Server 10.0 is the last release supporting publishing non-optimized map documents (MXD files). The next major release will only support publishing optimized maps (MSDs) as that is the best practice for map publishing. (There you have it, no more serving from MXDs after 10.0.)

ArcGIS Server 10.1 will be the last planned release for the ArcGIS Server Web ADFs (Application Developer Framework) for both Microsoft .NET and Java. (We had a small &#8220;wake&#8221; in San Diego for the ADFs. I won&#8217;t shed a tear when it&#8217;s &#8220;official.&#8221;)

ArcGIS Server 10.1 will no longer support local connections (DCOM connections) from Web ADF applications. ArcGIS Server 10.1 will be a web services (REST and SOAP) server only. (This is actually pretty major and the document details the impacts. <strong>If you have any ADF code doing editing and such, read this!</strong>)
</blockquote>


<p>There&#8217;s a lot of good information in the document, especially pertaining to ArcGIS Server so it&#8217;s definitely worth a read.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Paul Meems announced today that a new beta version of MapWindow is available. From the announcement:</p>

<blockquote>
We&#8217;ve just released the Beta Version of July.

It is available at <a href="http://svn.mapwindow.org/svnroot/InstallationProjects/4.8/Releases/MapWindowx86Full-v48Beta-installer.exe">http://svn.mapwindow.org/svnroot/InstallationProjects/4.8/Releases/MapWindowx86Full-v48Beta-installer.exe</a>

The supporting libraries (like GDAL, GEOS) have been updated to their latest versions.
A lot of new enhancements have been added to the ocx, like image grouping, image overviews (pyramids), symbology (charts and coloring), use of the rotation values in world files.
Not all new features made it yet to the Desktop, but we&#8217;re working on that.
The features are available to you for your plug-in or script development or when you develop a custom application using the ocx.
</blockquote>


<p>MapWindow is quite a powerful open-source (Mozilla Public License) mapping library for .NET. It&#8217;s under active development and seems to be adding capability rapidly. If you&#8217;re a developer looking for a library to add spatial capability to your application, you may want to check it out.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just got an e-mail announcement from <a href="http://www.arc2earth.com">Arc2Earth</a> (disclaimer: my <a href="http://www.zekiah.com">company</a> is a reseller) regarding some updates to version 3 that have come out since the ESRI UC. One of the updates that catches my attention is:</p>

<blockquote>
<strong>ArcGIS Server Tile Cache Format</strong> - You can now create or manage tile caches that can be used with ArcGIS Server. use Arc2Earth tile management tools (like the Change Detection Level) to dramatically reduce the time it takes to update tile caches

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Just a quick update on the <a href="http://www.geocommons.com">GeoCommons</a> importer for ArcMap <a href="http://geobabble.wordpress.com/2010/06/02/importing-data-from-geocommons-into-arcmap/">I blogged a while ago</a>:</p>

<p>There is now an ArcGIS 10.0 add-in available as a download from the Google Code site. It is available <a href="http://code.google.com/p/geocommonsbrowser/downloads/list">here</a>.</p>

<p>This should enable ArcGIS 10.0 users to also easily browse and get data from GeoCommons. Sorry, I don&#8217;t have the add-in code available yet. I&#8217;m a little swamped so it&#8217;ll be a while before I get to that but I wanted to make the download available.</p>
