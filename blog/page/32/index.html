  <div class="entry-content"><p>Okay, I swear I&#8217;m not on the DDJ payroll, but <a href="http://www.ddj.com/web-development/201202675">this article</a> caught my eye immediately. <a href="http://www.swaine.com/">Michael Swaine</a> has been on a roll lately but I think this one just drips with significance for the GIS community.</p>

<p>Over the past 10 years, as everyone has run screaming from the desktop, I&#8217;ve been a little mystified as to why it was considered a good thing to reduce a <a href="http://www.computerpoweruser.com/Editorial/article.asp?article=articles/archive/c0612/28c12/28c12.asp&amp;guid=">CPU more powerful than everything NASA had in 1969</a> to a mere vehicle for a browser. The browser-based model reduced our computers to really cool-looking equivalents of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VT220">VT220</a> so it&#8217;s nice to see that the market is starting to gain back a little sanity.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A few weeks ago, I blogged about the <a href="http://geobabble.wordpress.com/2007/07/09/mo-no-mo/">end of the line for MapObjects</a>. I waxed nostalgic about how fun it was to develop with MO and how, although I haven&#8217;t used it in a while, I&#8217;ll still be sad to see it go.</p>

<p>Well, I&#8217;m glad I&#8217;m over that! I been working with <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/SharpMap">SharpMap</a> for the last few weeks and I&#8217;m feeling that old MO vibe again. It started a few weeks ago with developing a data provider for SQLite (<a href="http://geobabble.wordpress.com/2007/07/31/extending-sharpmap-with-sqlite/">read here</a>) but I&#8217;ve continued to look under the hood.</p>

<p>Lately, I&#8217;ve been working a project where we need to feed some spatial data into native <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/netframework/aa663326.aspx">WPF</a> display. WPF offers high performance and great graphics quality. In addition, there are numerous other types of data involved that also need to be displayed. We didn&#8217;t want dedicated display components for each type of data so we decided to bring the spatial data into WPF.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This is WAY off-topic, for those of hitting this from Planet GS or an aggregator.</p>

<p>My deified status as been confirmed!</p>

<p>I was doing my weekly perusal of my spam folder to make sure SpamBayes didn&#8217;t actually filter something valid. I&#8217;m sure everyone has been getting the bogus &#8220;you&#8217;ve received a greeting card from a friend/family member/classmate/colleague/etc.&#8221; messages.</p>

<p>This one made me laugh&#8230;</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve always had a pretty high opinion of myself but I have apparently not been aiming high enough!</p>

<p>We now return to regularly scheduled programming.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://abegillespie.blogspot.com">Abe</a>, <a href="http://www.paolocorti.net">Paolo</a> and I had a chat session yesterday to coordinate efforts on <a href="http://code.google.com/p/ziggis">zigGIS</a>. It was good session and we&#8217;re all on the same page with getting zigGIS solidified.</p>

<p>The general theme of the outcome from yesterday is that we want to make zigGIS a solid experience for <a href="http://postgis.refractions.net/">PostGIS</a> users first. We have discussed other data sources in the past but we feel that we should nail down PostGIS first and then let that be a reference implementation for other data sources such as <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technology/products/spatial/index.html">Oracle Spatial</a>, <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/Wiki/View.aspx?ProjectName=MsSqlSpatial">MS SQL Spatial</a> and the like.</p>

<p>With that said, the most glaring gap in the current capability of zigGIS is editing. Meaning you can&#8217;t. Editing is our highest priority in the near future. Over the next few weeks, we will be developing use cases to define an editing workflow. We&#8217;ll also prototype ways to integrate zigGIS with the native editing capabilities of ArcMap in order to reduce the amount of custom editing code we need to write.</p>

<p>We&#8217;ll also be restructuring the existing code. The current code is rather flat in that individual .cs files contain multiple classes and the directory structure doesn&#8217;t reflect the namespaces. Fixing all of that will give us a little more flexibility with version control and managing distributed programming. It&#8217;ll also make it easier if&#8230;ahem&#8230;any other programmers want to join the project.</p>

<p>There are also still some performance issues with the current capabilities we need to iron out, such as the one <a href="http://geobabble.wordpress.com/2007/05/08/ziggis-and-spatial-references-part-3/">Bruce pointed out</a> a while ago.</p>

<p>Of course the catalog objects are ongoing but there may not be any movement on that until after we get the code restructured. Paolo is going on vacation for three weeks :D but Abe is planning to start the code restructure in the meantime as a way to re-familiarize himself with the code.</p>

<p>As always, the biggest impediment is time. It seems that the need to put food on the table refuses to go away but we should be able to build a little more forward momentum than we&#8217;ve seen recently.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Or vice versa.</p>

<p>A while back I posted about setting up a <a href="http://geobabble.wordpress.com/2007/06/19/my-little-open-source-stack/">GIS server using open source GIS technologies</a>. When I left off, I was going to start messing with <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/SharpMap">SharpMap</a>. I&#8217;ve been able to get back to that recently. I am working on a project where I need to do some basic spatial operations on a workstation but I want to keep a relatively small software foot print on the box. Of course, this screams &#8220;web service&#8221; or some such thing but the platform is mobile with no guaranteed network access.</p>

<p>So I went back to SharpMap. It&#8217;s footprint is relatively small (compared to ArcGIS) and the licensing model can&#8217;t be beat :-) . Next, I had to focus on the data source. I decided to look at <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/">SQLite</a> due to its small footprint. Additionally, the availabiliy of an <a href="http://sqlite.phxsoftware.com/">OLEDB driver</a> gave me option for non-spatial data that shapefiles alone didn&#8217;t (I just didn&#8217;t want to wrestle with the dBase driver).</p>

<p>So I got to do something I&#8217;ve wanted to do for a while: write my own data provider for SharpMap. There&#8217;s probably something out there already but how can I learn that way? So I based my data provider class on the class that already existed for MS SQL Server (MsSql.cs). It served as an excellent basis. I was surprised at how very easy it was to do this sort of implementation. The picture below depicts a SharpMap MapImage control with polygon data being read from SQLite.</p>

<p><a href="http://geobabble.files.wordpress.com/2007/07/sharpmap_sqlite.png" title="SharpMap desktop app with data from?SQLite"><img alt="SharpMap desktop app with data from?SQLite" src="http://geobabble.files.wordpress.com/2007/07/sharpmap_sqlite.thumbnail.png" /></a></p>

<p>SQLite is inherently text-based so I found it easier to store the geometry as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-known_text">WKT</a> rather that <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/gis-wkb-format.html">WKB</a> but that actually helps me with another project requirement: displaying the data in a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Presentation_Foundation">WPF</a> form. Transforming the WKT to <a href="http://www.xaml.net/">XAML</a> will be easier but I digress.</p>

<p>I am very impressed with the updates being made to SharpMap. I feel like I&#8217;m just scratching the surface of what it can do. Version 2.0 has not technically been released but I have found the latest builds to be very stable and I&#8217;m moving forward without hesitation using it in my project.</p>

<p>I have uploaded my code below. Just rename it to a .cs file.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Things have been REALLY slow on <a href="http://code.google.com/p/ziggis">zigGIS</a> for a while. All of us (Paolo, Abe, me) have all been up to our eyeballs with work, leaving little time to work on the zig. Now that <a href="http://www.digital-pulp.com/">Abe is out on his own</a>, the three of us have been trying to coordinate a chat session to lay out a little bit of a way ahead. That has proven somewhat difficult in itself. I think the best way to handle it at this point is for Abe and I to go out to Rome and sit down with Paolo ;-) .</p>

<p>Anyway, I had a little time so I pushed forward on the catalog objects. I&#8217;ve got it down to where the layers for a <a href="http://postgis.refractions.net/">PostGIS</a> database actually show up in the ArcCatalog tree but it&#8217;s still a little flaky from there. The screenshot below shows what I&#8217;ve got. You&#8217;ll notice that the geometry icons don&#8217;t show up. Well, the layer doesn&#8217;t draw in ArcCatalog either but everything still works fine in ArcMap.</p>

<p><img alt="It?s a little closer?" src="http://geobabble.files.wordpress.com/2007/07/zigcatalog.png" /></p>

<p>So now that I&#8217;ve got the hierarchy fleshed out, I can focus on the display logic. Incidentally, the attributes for the layers do show up so all is not completely lost.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve got for now. I can&#8217;t vouch for a specific schedule for a new release but we&#8217;re trying to coordinate that.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Anyone who has browsed this blog enough has probably figured out that I am a fan of <a href="http://www.ddj.com">Doctor Dobb&#8217;s Journal</a>. This month&#8217;s issue inaugurates <a href="http://www.ddj.com/dept/architect/200001985">a new column by Herb Sutter</a> dealing with concurrency. In my opinion, the confluence of mult-processor/multi-core systems with a greater emphasis on server-based GIS makes concurrency a huge issue for the GIS community.</p>

<p>The most obvious example of where concurrency can be of benefit is ArcGIS Server. The entire ArcObjects library is exposed in such a way that complex geospatial operations can be published as services. Many such operations can benefit from concurrency, especially as they are executed in a multi-user, server-based context.</p>

<p>I am of the opinion that the current 9.x architecture of AGS (with COM under the hood) is not optimally suited for such an approach but it will be interesting to see how <a href="http://www.esri.com">ESRI</a> addresses concurrency as 10.0 evolves. I also view the current AGS as a step along a path rather than an intended end state. Of course, there are other technologies out there. I merely hold up AGS as an obvious and visible example of a product that can benefit from being built with concurrency in mind. Of course, it&#8217;s up to us as software developers to correctly build our apps as well.</p>

<p>That said, I highly recommend this column. The inaugural installment rightly kicks off from a conceptual standpoint but I suspect we&#8217;ll be in the weeds soon enough.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Just back from vacation :-( and as a way of easing back into things, I have been tinkering with my <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/netframework/aa663324.aspx">WCF</a> project that&#8217;s been sitting while the paying work has gotten done. It&#8217;s the one that wraps PostGIS coordinate conversion as a web service written using WCF. My copy of &#8221;<a href="http://www.wrox.com/WileyCDA/WroxTitle/productCd-0470089849.html">Professional WCF Programming</a>&#8221; arrived while I was gone so I had some incentive. The purpose of this project is more to get me comfortable with WCF than anything to do with coordinate conversion.</p>

<p>Anyway, I have a simple WinForms client to test my service calls but I&#8217;ve noticed I need to clean and rebuild the project a lot. Suddenly, I had a flashback:</p>

<p><img alt="How do I get rid of all these?pseudocodes?" src="http://geobabble.files.wordpress.com/2007/07/vs2005_build_menu.png" /></p>

<p>I&#8217;m using build and clean again! If only there had been an AML editor as nice as this one&#8230;</p>

<p>Oh well, back to work.</p>
