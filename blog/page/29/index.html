  <div class="entry-content"><p>Congratulations to <a href="http://www.paolocorti.net/public/wordpress/index.php/2007/03/21/ziggis-12-released">Paolo</a> for getting <a href="http://code.google.com/p/ziggis">zigGIS</a> 1.2 out the door. He&#8217;s put a lot of work into fixing problems with selections and renderers and making it a much more usable tool.</p>

<p>His post contains a list of features implemented at this version and it&#8217;s really a huge step forward. I am focusing on developing catalog objects but my recent upgrade to 9.2 has me doing regression testing on a lot of my code for my clients. Paolo deserves credit for really taking the bull by the horns for this release.</p>

<p>Those of you who are looking at the feature list for 9.3 and seeing PostgreSQL support should come on over. It&#8217;s already here. ;-)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Updating my <a href="http://geobabble.wordpress.com/2006/12/17/postgis-and-arcgis-91/">earlier post</a>:</p>

<p>I completed my upgrade to 9.2 yesterday with the installation of the last service pack. The first thing I did was upgrade <a href="http://code.google.com/p/ziggis">zigGIS</a> to ensure that there wouldn&#8217;t be problems. I have to say that the first thing I noticed was all of the tools ESRI has integrated with VS2005. I liked what they did with 2003 but these are even better. One thing I liked was the &#8220;Add ArcGIS Reference&#8221; tool. It updated my old 9.1 references to 9.2 without my having to remove them first. It was nice to have that step taken away.</p>

<p>That was all I needed to do. After I upgraded the references and built the project, it worked like a charm. I&#8217;ve got to work on a clean way to swap the references in and out, though. <a href="http://www.paolocorti.net">Paolo</a> is still at 9.0. When I was at 9.1, I would have to go and update references every time a pulled a new version from Google Code. Right now, I just keep a copy of the .csproj off to the side but there should be a more elegant way to do it.</p>

<p>So the good news is that zigGIS has now been verified against 9.0 (SP3), 9.1 and 9.2.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Okay, I have no one to blame but myself. I have Desktop and the full EDN kit (except for ArcIMS) installed. Therefore, I&#8217;ve uninistalled everything 9.1 and reinstalled everything 9.2 and now I get to do the service packs. One day, I&#8217;ll get back to coding, I&#8217;m sure.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><strong><strong>UPDATE</strong></strong><em>Check the comments for the resolution to this. 9.2 offers a registry setting and, since I&#8217;m upgrading, I&#8217;ll make use of that. I got pretty far on my API hack though.</em></p>

<p>My question is twofold: First: Can you stop this dialog from appearing in ArcMap 9.1? Second: If not, does 9.2 give you the option to turn this thing off?</p>

<p><img alt="ArcMap Drawing Errors?Dialog" src="http://geobabble.files.wordpress.com/2007/02/arcmap_draw_error.JPG" /></p>

<p>I have posted a similar query on the ESRI forums but I thought the blogosphere may be able to weigh in on this. This dialog was introduced at 9.1 as a &#8220;feature&#8221; but it&#8217;s not the most developer-friendly thing in the world. A little background:</p>

<p>I have an application running as a Windows service that is receiving data and stuffing it into ArcSDE. I have another app that&#8217;s an ArcMap extension. It refreshed the map on a specified interval and shows the new data as it comes in. There is no syncronization between the two. As you would expect, there are occaionally collisions. The ArcSDE layer may be in load-only mode or something similar. I have a lot of exception-handling in place to trap all of those kinds of things.</p>

<p>This dialog defies all of that. Despite my exception handling, it still pops up and it completely freaks out my users. I would like to turn it off. (I would really like to kill it.) I can&#8217;t find a registry setting or any other such option that allows me to do that so I&#8217;m stumped. Any help would be appreciated and I promise to sing your praises on this blog if you have the solution.</p>

<p>For background: we are using 9.1 (for a number of reasons). We are starting the upgrade planning to go to 9.2. If 9.2 fixes this, then I&#8217;ll stop worrying about it. Any useful info would be very helpful. My next step is some slimy Windows API hack to suppress the damned thing.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The last couple of days have shown some traffic being driven to my blog from search terms such as &#8220;opening zig file&#8221; so I thought I&#8217;d offer up a discussion of the format.</p>

<p>Abe Gillespie, the original developer of <a href="http://code.google.com/p/ziggis">zigGIS</a>, developed the zig file as a means of persisting PostGIS connection information used to access a layer and display it in ArcMap. He threw us a blast from the past by choosing the old Windows INI format as the zig file syntax. I admire the choice because, truth be told, I still use that format from time to time. For simple configuration information, it&#8217;s more efficient than XML.</div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>An <a href="http://www.ddj.com/dept/webservices/197003355">article</a> in the latest Dr. Dobb&#8217;s caught my eye. It&#8217;s about MyMap; a javascript api that standardizes the calls between Google Maps, Yahoo Maps and Virtual Earth. I&#8217;m always drawn when mapping tools get press outside of the GIS world. MyMap is predicated on the idea that each mapping engine provides similar capabilities. There is a different .js file for each but the function calls are the same. Therefore, it makes it relatively easy to provide similar capabilities for your web app regardless of the back-end engine.</p>

<p>I installed the <a href="ftp://66.77.27.238/sourcecode/ddj/2007/0703.zip">sample</a> from the DDJ resource center and it&#8217;s pretty straightforward. You may need to comment out the call to Google Maps because the API key won&#8217;t work for you. If you have your own, you can use that. Either way, the Yahoo and VE calls work fine and give good idea of how MyMap works. I&#8217;d recommend checking it out.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Things have been a little slow on the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/ziggis/">zigGIS</a> front for the last few weeks. Both Paolo and I have been incredibly busy at work. We have both made some updates but it&#8217;s been hard to pull them together into a coherent release. That&#8217;s getting very close now. Enhancements this time around will include:</p>

<ol>
    <li>On-the-fly reprojection - We have been able to get layers with different SRIDs to overlay correctly. Also, you can change the SRIF of the map and the layers display correctly. Obviously, we haven&#8217;t tested every spatial reference out there but we&#8217;re encouraged.</li>
    <li>Dataset Enumeration - We can now list the PostGIS layers in the database to which we connect. Paolo has implemented a new dialog that allows you to pick the layer you want rather than having to type it.</li>
    <li>Use of a PropertySet for workspace properties - It&#8217;s now not as tightly coupled to the .zig file and more consistent with how other data sources are implemented in ArcGIS</li>
</ol>


<p>Paolo is working hard to pull all of our changes together and get a release out soon. There are probably other updates that I&#8217;m missing but there will be a full accounting once the release is out. We&#8217;re still working toward some bigger issues, such as editing. Also, we&#8217;ve begun the development of some catalog objects. Those will be addressed in subsequent releases.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Steve has <a href="http://thesteve0.wordpress.com/2007/02/06/notes-from-the-esri-cahinvguam-regional-users-group/">blogged</a> about Clint Brown&#8217;s talk at the CA/HI/NV/Guam RUG meeting. There&#8217;s nothing particularly suprprising but we&#8217;re starting to get dates and features tied to version numbers.</p>

<p>I am encouraged that 9.3 will be in beta soon. ESRI&#8217;s odd-numbered releases are always more stable. The support for <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a> with ArcSDE is not a surprise. It will be interesting to see whether that ends up being a port of ArcSDE to PostgreSQL or whether they will take advantage of <a href="http://postgis.refractions.net/">PostGIS</a>. I suspect the former. However, the ability to choose an open-source RDBMS greatly reduces the overall cost of implementing ArcSDE. That can only be a good thing. Also, I&#8217;m glad they chose PostgreSQL rather than <a href="http://www.mysql.com/">MySQL</a>. At the risk of slings and arrows, I much prefer PG to MySQL.</p>

<p>I am particularly encouraged by some of the features planned for 10.0. I also don&#8217;t see most of those features happening without ArcGIS finally moving away from COM. That will be an extremely welcome change. Hopefully, they will go straight to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Presentation_Foundation">WPF</a> for the UI.</p>

<p>So what about <a href="http://code.google.com/p/ziggis/">zigGIS</a>? I see no reason to stop. If ESRI just implements PostGIS, maybe zigGIS becomes redundant but I suspect the GPL will prevent them from doing that. Therefore, I see it being more of a port of the existing ArcSDE. Anyway, I think the need for a completely free connector to PostGIS will continue, so we will keep moving forward.</p>

<p>All in all, I&#8217;m encouraged by what&#8217;s on the way with regard to the technology. I&#8217;d still like to get more of an idea who ESRI&#8217;s &#8220;Steve Ballmer&#8221; is, though.</p>
