  <div class="entry-content"><p>Or vice versa.</p>

<p>A while back I posted about setting up a <a href="http://geobabble.wordpress.com/2007/06/19/my-little-open-source-stack/">GIS server using open source GIS technologies</a>. When I left off, I was going to start messing with <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/SharpMap">SharpMap</a>. I&#8217;ve been able to get back to that recently. I am working on a project where I need to do some basic spatial operations on a workstation but I want to keep a relatively small software foot print on the box. Of course, this screams &#8220;web service&#8221; or some such thing but the platform is mobile with no guaranteed network access.</p>

<p>So I went back to SharpMap. It&#8217;s footprint is relatively small (compared to ArcGIS) and the licensing model can&#8217;t be beat :-) . Next, I had to focus on the data source. I decided to look at <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/">SQLite</a> due to its small footprint. Additionally, the availabiliy of an <a href="http://sqlite.phxsoftware.com/">OLEDB driver</a> gave me option for non-spatial data that shapefiles alone didn&#8217;t (I just didn&#8217;t want to wrestle with the dBase driver).</p>

<p>So I got to do something I&#8217;ve wanted to do for a while: write my own data provider for SharpMap. There&#8217;s probably something out there already but how can I learn that way? So I based my data provider class on the class that already existed for MS SQL Server (MsSql.cs). It served as an excellent basis. I was surprised at how very easy it was to do this sort of implementation. The picture below depicts a SharpMap MapImage control with polygon data being read from SQLite.</p>

<p><a href="http://geobabble.files.wordpress.com/2007/07/sharpmap_sqlite.png" title="SharpMap desktop app with data from?SQLite"><img alt="SharpMap desktop app with data from?SQLite" src="http://geobabble.files.wordpress.com/2007/07/sharpmap_sqlite.thumbnail.png" /></a></p>

<p>SQLite is inherently text-based so I found it easier to store the geometry as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-known_text">WKT</a> rather that <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/gis-wkb-format.html">WKB</a> but that actually helps me with another project requirement: displaying the data in a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Presentation_Foundation">WPF</a> form. Transforming the WKT to <a href="http://www.xaml.net/">XAML</a> will be easier but I digress.</p>

<p>I am very impressed with the updates being made to SharpMap. I feel like I&#8217;m just scratching the surface of what it can do. Version 2.0 has not technically been released but I have found the latest builds to be very stable and I&#8217;m moving forward without hesitation using it in my project.</p>

<p>I have uploaded my code below. Just rename it to a .cs file.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Things have been REALLY slow on <a href="http://code.google.com/p/ziggis">zigGIS</a> for a while. All of us (Paolo, Abe, me) have all been up to our eyeballs with work, leaving little time to work on the zig. Now that <a href="http://www.digital-pulp.com/">Abe is out on his own</a>, the three of us have been trying to coordinate a chat session to lay out a little bit of a way ahead. That has proven somewhat difficult in itself. I think the best way to handle it at this point is for Abe and I to go out to Rome and sit down with Paolo ;-) .</p>

<p>Anyway, I had a little time so I pushed forward on the catalog objects. I&#8217;ve got it down to where the layers for a <a href="http://postgis.refractions.net/">PostGIS</a> database actually show up in the ArcCatalog tree but it&#8217;s still a little flaky from there. The screenshot below shows what I&#8217;ve got. You&#8217;ll notice that the geometry icons don&#8217;t show up. Well, the layer doesn&#8217;t draw in ArcCatalog either but everything still works fine in ArcMap.</p>

<p><img alt="It?s a little closer?" src="http://geobabble.files.wordpress.com/2007/07/zigcatalog.png" /></p>

<p>So now that I&#8217;ve got the hierarchy fleshed out, I can focus on the display logic. Incidentally, the attributes for the layers do show up so all is not completely lost.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve got for now. I can&#8217;t vouch for a specific schedule for a new release but we&#8217;re trying to coordinate that.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Anyone who has browsed this blog enough has probably figured out that I am a fan of <a href="http://www.ddj.com">Doctor Dobb&#8217;s Journal</a>. This month&#8217;s issue inaugurates <a href="http://www.ddj.com/dept/architect/200001985">a new column by Herb Sutter</a> dealing with concurrency. In my opinion, the confluence of mult-processor/multi-core systems with a greater emphasis on server-based GIS makes concurrency a huge issue for the GIS community.</p>

<p>The most obvious example of where concurrency can be of benefit is ArcGIS Server. The entire ArcObjects library is exposed in such a way that complex geospatial operations can be published as services. Many such operations can benefit from concurrency, especially as they are executed in a multi-user, server-based context.</p>

<p>I am of the opinion that the current 9.x architecture of AGS (with COM under the hood) is not optimally suited for such an approach but it will be interesting to see how <a href="http://www.esri.com">ESRI</a> addresses concurrency as 10.0 evolves. I also view the current AGS as a step along a path rather than an intended end state. Of course, there are other technologies out there. I merely hold up AGS as an obvious and visible example of a product that can benefit from being built with concurrency in mind. Of course, it&#8217;s up to us as software developers to correctly build our apps as well.</p>

<p>That said, I highly recommend this column. The inaugural installment rightly kicks off from a conceptual standpoint but I suspect we&#8217;ll be in the weeds soon enough.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Just back from vacation :-( and as a way of easing back into things, I have been tinkering with my <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/netframework/aa663324.aspx">WCF</a> project that&#8217;s been sitting while the paying work has gotten done. It&#8217;s the one that wraps PostGIS coordinate conversion as a web service written using WCF. My copy of &#8221;<a href="http://www.wrox.com/WileyCDA/WroxTitle/productCd-0470089849.html">Professional WCF Programming</a>&#8221; arrived while I was gone so I had some incentive. The purpose of this project is more to get me comfortable with WCF than anything to do with coordinate conversion.</p>

<p>Anyway, I have a simple WinForms client to test my service calls but I&#8217;ve noticed I need to clean and rebuild the project a lot. Suddenly, I had a flashback:</p>

<p><img alt="How do I get rid of all these?pseudocodes?" src="http://geobabble.files.wordpress.com/2007/07/vs2005_build_menu.png" /></p>

<p>I&#8217;m using build and clean again! If only there had been an AML editor as nice as this one&#8230;</p>

<p>Oh well, back to work.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This will be my last post for a couple of weeks. I&#8217;m heading out to Florida tomorrow to spend time with my family and the Mouse. But before I head out, I thought I&#8217;d share a little something I&#8217;ve been working on.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been playing the last few days with the <a href="http://edndoc.esri.com/arcobjects/9.2/ComponentHelp/esriDataSourcesGDB/InMemoryWorkspaceFactory.htm">InMemoryWorkspaceFactory</a> class in ArcObjects. I am looking at using it for a project I will be working on when I get back so I thought I&#8217;d do a little prototyping beforehand.</p>

<p>The fact that it works in memory is very attractive, especially for using volatile data. <a href="http://georss.org/">GeoRSS</a> seemed like a natural source to use for prototyping.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Okay, there&#8217;s nothing terribly surprising about ESRI&#8217;s announcement regarding <a href="http://www.esri.com/software/mapobjects/index.html">MapObjects</a> in this <a href="http://support.esri.com/index.cfm?fa=knowledgebase.techarticles.articleShow&amp;d=31074">technical article</a>. I would have been more surprised if they had announced that it <em>would</em> be supported or that there would be another version or something like that. In truth, I haven&#8217;t touched MapObjects in years. It was dead to me even if it was still on life support at ESRI. But there was something about seeing it in print:</p>

<blockquote>MapObjects Windows 2.4 and MapObjects-Java 2.2 and 2.3 are not supported on the Windows Vista. ESRI is not certifying any new environments for MapObjects-Windows and there are no plans to support Vista with MapObjects-Java.</blockquote>


<p>It brought back a lot of memories. I began programming when I was 10. I wrote a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeons_and_dragons">D&amp;D</a> character generator in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC_programming_language">BASIC</a> on a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_64">Commodore 64</a>. I guess that makes me an old geek. D&amp;D and computers might even be a double-down. ;-)? I&#8217;ve pretty much been doing some form of BASIC ever since (not so much VB.Net anymore, though, as I do most of my .Net in C#) along with a lot of other languages. I got interested in maps a few years later and discovered I could fuse maps and computers as I headed into the workforce.</p>

<p>Early on, I was able to do some <a href="http://extranet.mapinfo.com/products/Overview.cfm?productid=1063">MapBasic</a> stuff but that didn&#8217;t get too far. So I suffered through AML and Avenue for a while in order to feed the GIS development jones. Then along came MO.</p>

<p>With MO, I was able to introduce an old friend (BASIC in the form of VB5 and later VB6) to a new friend (GIS, although it wasn&#8217;t new to me by then). I was able to write real apps that fused mapping with databases and other cool tools. For one customer, I built a COM system that featured a core UI and provided a pluggable architecture and an API so others could write plug-ins. Then we converted a lot of stand-alone apps to work in the system. Sounds familiar huh?</p>

<p>From a GIS standpoint, MO wasn&#8217;t the most powerful game in town but it was <em>fun</em>! And, if you needed an algorithm or something that MO didn&#8217;t support, you could just implement it yourself in the language of your choice. There are operations that I originally implemented in MO/VB6 that I have migrated and still use in C#/ArcObjects/Others. In case I didn&#8217;t get the point across earlier, it was just plain fun.</p>

<p>That was a while ago. GIS is still fun but I just don&#8217;t use MO anymore (maybe that&#8217;s the problem). ESRI&#8217;s announcement is sort of like when you read that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_Centre">the arena where you went to all of your concerts in your youth got dynamited to make room for a shopping plaza</a>. So, much like I did that day, I&#8217;ll pop a cold one, raise a glass and say &#8220;Thanks for the memories.&#8221;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>These are pretty fun times to be working in GIS. There&#8217;s an explosion of new technologies across the whole spectrum and integration possibilities are seemingly boundless. Back when I got started, <a href="http://www.esri.com">ESRI</a> and <a href="http://www.intergraph.com">Intergaph</a> were duking it out and others, like <a href="http://www.mapinfo.com">MapInfo</a>, were out there on the periphery also. <a href="http://grass.itc.it/">GRASS</a> was flying the OS banner and there were a few good free tools, such as the various ones put out by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sol_Katz">Sol Katz</a> at the <a href="http://www.blm.gov/wo/st/en.html">BLM</a>.</p>

<p>Everything quieted down for a few years but there&#8217;s been a flowering of new technologies (well-documented elsewhere) over the last couple of years in both the commercial and open-source communities. I am particularly impressed with the pace at which the open-source community has ramped up with tools of strong quality and capability. In addition, the back-and-forth between <a href="http://earth.google.com/">Google</a> and <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/virtualearth/default.mspx">Microsoft</a> has put better tools in the hands of the average consumer. That doesn&#8217;t come without drawbacks, but I see it as a net positive.</p>

<p>What I find interesting about all of this activity is that it demonstrates that the closed/commerical/competitive approach can bear fruit and so can the open-source/free/collaborative approach. Where you fall in the spectrum between the two is totally up to you but no one can offer up any concrete evidence that one is vastly superior to the other at this point. In addition, it&#8217;s becoming increasingly clear that they don&#8217;t have to be mutually exclusive.</p>

<p>When you throw in <a href="http://www.opengeospatial.org">OGC</a> standards and well as <em>de facto</em> standards such as <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/kml/documentation/">KML</a>, it becomes quite possible to stitch together technologies of various parentage effectively. I offer up the following as a concrete example:</p>

<p><a href="http://geobabble.files.wordpress.com/2007/06/os_free_commercial.png" title="Click to enlarge..."><img src="http://geobabble.files.wordpress.com/2007/06/os_free_commercial.thumbnail.png" /></a></p>

<p>This screenshot depicts a map (no, it&#8217;s not pretty but blame that on me) that was assembled using several technologies. The application is obviously <a href="http://www.esri.com/software/arcgis/about/desktop_gis.html">ArcMap</a>. Working from the bottom up, the layers are:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Counties - US Counties residing in <a href="http://www.esri.com/software/arcgis/arcsde/">ArcSDE</a> and <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/sql/default.mspx">SQL Server</a></li>
    <li>State Boundaries - US States loaded directly from a local install of <a href="http://postgis.refractions.net/">PostGIS</a> using the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/ziggis/">zigGIS</a> connector</li>
    <li>Major Water - A shapefile on the local hard drive</li>
    <li>Hospitals - A <a href="http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/wfs">WFS</a> layer being served from my <a href="http://geoserver.org/">GeoServer</a> <a href="http://geobabble.wordpress.com/2007/06/19/my-little-open-source-stack/">instance</a> and loaded into ArcMap with the help of the free <a href="http://www.thecarbonproject.com/carbonarc.php">CarbonArc Lite</a> extension from the <a href="http://www.thecarbonproject.com">Carbon Project</a>. Behind Geoserver, the data sits in PostGIS.</li>
</ul>


<p>So we have commercially licensed software (ArcMap, ArcSDE, SQL Server), freeware (CarbonArc Lite) and open-source software (zigGIS, PostGIS, GeoServer, <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a>) working together to make this product. All are good tools that, working together, bolster each others&#8217; shortcomings. This kind of thing demostrates the &#8220;best-of-breed&#8221; (hate that term) concept very well.</p>

<p>A few months back, <a href="http://www.paolocorti.net/public/wordpress/index.php/2007/01/19/full-oss-solution-vs-osscommercial-solution-mix/">Paolo posted</a> about mixing commercial and open-source tools. I think this will eventually be the prevalent means of doing business.</p>
