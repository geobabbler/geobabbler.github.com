  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have finalized my travel plans for San Diego to attend the ESRI User Conference this year. I will be spending most of my time on the exhibit floor working a booth. My company, <a href="http://www.zekiah.com">Zekiah Technologies</a>, became a <a href="http://www.zekiah.com/gsa">GSA reseller</a> for <a href="http://www.arc2earth.com">Arc2Earth</a> this year so Zekiah will have a joint booth with Arc2Earth.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll be there with Brian and Jack Flood and we&#8217;ll have the newly-released Arc2Earth v3 on display. Come by booth 632 to see A2E Cloud Services (using Google&#8217;s Cloud) in action as well as integration with <a href="http://www.arcgis.com/home/">ArcGIS.com</a> and a number of other features, including the new ability to export ArcGIS layer styles to <a href="http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/sld">SLD</a> (more on that in a future post). Don&#8217;t forget the free A2E Community Edition. If you won&#8217;t be at the UC, that&#8217;s a great way to check out what it can do.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Shortly after my <a href="http://geobabble.wordpress.com/2010/06/02/importing-data-from-geocommons-into-arcmap/">previous post</a>, about browsing and downloading data from <a href="http://www.geocommons.com">GeoCommons</a>, hit the wires, I got quite a few back-channel requests for the code. I sent it out via e-mail to a number of people and then posted it via DropBox. I have finally gotten around to posting it up on Google Code, making things much more manageable. It is now available <a href="http://code.google.com/p/geocommonsbrowser/">here</a>.</p>

<p>I have made a few updates since the original post. Some were administrative but were functional. They are:</p>

<ol>
<li>The code was updated to replace SharpZipLib with <a href="http://dotnetzip.codeplex.com">DotNetZip</a> for handling zip files.</li>
<li>The code now attempts to identify the default KML handler on the user&#8217;s system and pass KML directly to it for previewing.</li>
<li>The user now gets a wait cursor when the tool is processing downloads and such. This should make it a little more usable.</li>
<li>The code headers had been pasted in from <a href="http://sharpmap.codeplex.com">SharpMap</a> and I missed some references to SharpMap in the text. Those have been corrected.</li>
</ol>


<p>Anyway, thanks for all the interest. It sort of caught me off guard but at least the code is more accessible now. I&#8217;ve got a few more updates planned so this should streamline things.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> <em>The code for this post is available at the bottom of the page.</em></p>

<p>I have been doing a lot of development with the <a href="http://resources.esri.com/arcgisserver/apis/silverlight/">ESRI Silverlight API</a> recently. One of the requirements of my project is to be able to dynamically add KML data at runtime. The incorporation of <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/kml/documentation/">KML</a> was handled for us through <a href="http://resources.esri.com/arcgisserver/apis/silverlight/index.cfm?fa=codeGalleryDetails&amp;scriptID=16487">one of the ESRI samples</a> on the resource center so we pretty much just had to integrate that code and test against our use cases. For testing, I typically reached out to <a href="http://www.geocommons.com">GeoCommons</a> since any data set available there can be streamed as KML.</p>

<p>Obviously, this is not my first exposure to GeoCommons but, when discussing it, I found that many of the analysts I spoke with were not aware of it and did not use it much. So I decided to tackle developing a simple ArcMap extension to allow a user to search GeoCommons and then download/add data to ArcMap without the need to manually download, unzip and add the data themselves.</div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I found this map on display at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cranberry_Glades">Cranberry Glades</a> <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=38.203056,+-80.266389&amp;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&amp;sspn=38.41771,79.013672&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=38.202576,-80.266113&amp;spn=0.596777,1.234589&amp;z=10">visitor center</a> in West Virginia (click any of the pictures to enlarge them):</p>

<p>One of the rangers working there told me it is to scale (although the quilt itself lacks any indication of scale).</p>

<p>The next two pictures are close-ups showing the north arrow and the use of buttons as place markers. The kids we are traveling with were fascinated by this map. You will notice a red box over a portion of the forest. That was the area covered by a relief map on a table elsewhere in the visitor center.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Shortly after ESRI announced the re-christening of ArcGIS 9.4 to ArcGIS 10.0, I posted <a href="http://geobabble.wordpress.com/2010/01/13/first-thoughts-on-arcgis-10-0/">this</a>. In that post, I expressed doubt as to whether it would really live up to major release status.</p>

<p>After having worked with ArcGIS 10 for a little while now, I feel it necessary to say that I was wrong. Due to the nature of recent projects, I have been experimenting mostly with Desktop. At the FedUC, it looked really impressive in demos up on the big screen but those were demos up on the big screen.</p>

<p>Working with the release candidate, I have found it to be impressively fast and stable with fairly modest hardware resources. Many processes seem to run in the background where they used to lock ArcMap and prevent you from working. Also, the updated UI is a breath of fresh air. These things, combined with many other improvements, have convinced me that the move up to 10.0 was justified, as it is obvious that major restructuring has occurred. I&#8217;m still digging into how it may affect some of my previously-existing code but there&#8217;s really nothing that scares me about that. I&#8217;ll blog about the code migration in future posts, I&#8217;m sure.</p>

<p>Given what I had previously posted, I felt it only fair to correct it based upon what I have observed. It looks like some good work from the folks in Redlands and I am looking forward to the full release.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><strong>Update:</strong> zigGIS has been discontinued.</p>

<p><a href="http://abegillespie.blogspot.com/2010/04/prodigal-extension.html">Abe officially announced</a> today that the next major release of <a href="http://pub.obtusesoft.com">zigGIS</a>, version 3.0, will return to open-source. This announcement was followed up with a message on the zigGIS Google Group. A snippet of that message is here:</p>

<blockquote>
We have some exciting news.  The next version of zigGIS will officially return to being truly open source.  That means zigGIS 3.0 will be free to download and use.

Of course this doesn&#8217;t mean zigGIS 3.0 will be free to develop. Though zigGIS is held near and dear to the hearts of the Obtuse Software team it cannot be developed on love alone.  So we we&#8217;ll be seeking funding in ways alternative to selling licenses.  We&#8217;ll follow a more traditional open source model of accepting personal donations and corporate sponsorships and selling support contracts.

Version 2.x will continue to be supported on the forums here and licenses sold at obtusesoft.com.  However, all funds will be applied directly to the development of 3.0.
</blockquote>


<p>I&#8217;m glad that zigGIS is returning to its open-source roots. Since the release of 2.0, the zigGIS user community has grown a lot and there has been interest from other developers in extending it in new ways. I am excited by the prospect of the involvement of a wider community of users and developers in its advancement.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Over the past few weeks, I have been reading a copy of the upcoming book by Regina Obe and Leo Hsu titled &#8221;<a href="http://manning.com/obe/">PostGIS In Action</a>.&#8221; Through my work with <a href="http://pub.obtusesoft.com">zigGIS</a> and some of my consulting work with <a href="http://www.zekiah.com">Zekiah</a>, I have been using <a href="http://postgis.refractions.net/">PostGIS</a> with good results for some time now. I have found that it matches or exceeds the capabilities of its commercial counterparts and I can be quite productive with it.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="http://www.manning.com/obe/obe_cover150.jpg" /></p>

<p>Regina has been a frequent contributor to zigGIS discussions over the years and her expertise with PostGIS has definitely helped <a href="http://dpulp.com/">Abe</a>, <a href="http://www.paolocorti.net/">Paolo</a> and I as we have worked on it. Also, many tips from the <a href="http://www.bostongis.com/">Boston GIS blog/site</a> have been very helpful so I have been looking forward to this book for some time.</div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The first <a href="http://www.somdgc.org/Default.aspx">Southern Maryland GiveCamp</a> is happening this weekend at <a href="http://www.smcm.edu/">St. Mary&#8217;s College of Maryland</a> in <a href="http://www.stmaryscity.org/">St. Mary&#8217;s City</a> for the benefit of <a href="http://www.somdgc.org/Request.aspx">19 local non-profits</a>. If you are unfamiliar with the concept of a GiveCamp, the web site sums it up but here is an excerpt:</p>

<blockquote>
GiveCamp is a weekend-long event where software developers, designers, and database administrators donate their time to create custom software for non-profit organizations. This custom software could be a new website for the nonprofit organization, or a small data-collection application to keep track of members. The only limitation is that the project should be scoped to be able to be completed in a weekend.
</blockquote>


<p>The Southern Maryland GiveCamp is being put together by <a href="http://jpendarvis.blogspot.com/">Jim Pendarvis</a>, who is putting an enormous amount of work into it. I had planned to participate but events have conspired to prevent that, although three of my <a href="http://www.zekiah.com">Zekiah</a> co-workers will be there.</p>

<p><strong>Jim still needs volunteers</strong>. If you are a developer in the Washington, DC area, I strongly encourage you to volunteer your time (<a href="http://www.somdgc.org/Tech.aspx">technical</a> and <a href="http://www.somdgc.org/NonTech.aspx">non-technical</a> volunteers are being sought). In addition to helping the community, you&#8217;ll also get the added benefit of spending the weekend in one of the <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;q=Saint+Marys+City,+St.+Mary's,+Maryland&amp;sll=-33.76676,150.774015&amp;sspn=0.039529,0.077162&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;cd=1&amp;geocode=FT6wRgIdJLRx-w&amp;split=0&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=Saint+Marys+City,+St.+Mary's,+Maryland&amp;ll=38.193942,-76.434288&amp;spn=0.074742,0.154324&amp;z=13&amp;iwloc=A">most beautiful locales in the region</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Several years ago, I took my family with me to the <a href="http://www.esri.com">ESRI</a> International User Conference and we spent a lot of time checking things out around San Diego. My son also participated in ?GIS Kids Camp? at the UC, where ESRI staff took kids through a few scenarios so they could do some simple analysis, data processing and mapping to get a feel for GIS. My son loved it and I think it was a good program that ESRI did a great job putting together.</div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A while back, I posted <a href="http://geobabble.wordpress.com/2008/01/07/sharpmap-on-apache/">this</a> about running <a href="http://sharpmap.codeplex.com">SharpMap</a> on <a href="http://www.apache.org/">Apache</a>. At the time, the ability to run ASP.NET on Apache was mainly a curiosity to me but had little practical value. Recently, I had the need to revisit this technique for a project. I used the same <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/israelio/archive/2005/09/11/424852.aspx">post</a> I had used previously as a reference, although the comment by Carlos there was more up-to-date and served me well this time.</p>

<p>This time, we were migrating an old custom-built site to the <a href="http://drupal.org/">Drupal</a> CMS. The old site was a mixture of ASP Classic and ASP.NET. Drupal is a <a href="http://www.php.net/">PHP</a>-based CMS. Due to the deadline for completing the migration, there were two ASP.NET applications that we planned to leave in place. They automated custom workflows and our schedule didn&#8217;t allow for rewriting them. Drupal had been installed as part of the <a href="http://acquia.com/downloads">Acquia stack installer</a> that includes Apache, PHP, Drupal and <a href="http://www.mysql.com/">MySQL</a>.</p>

<p>Following the instructions I had used previously, I integrated mod_aspdotnet in the Apache http.conf. I made the following entries, as instructed (these are sample entries for purposes of this post).</p>

<p> <code>AspNetMount /SampleASP "c:/SampleASP"
 Alias /SampleASP "c:/SampleASP"</code></p>

<p>These entries mount the ASP.NET application where it sits physically and alias it to a virtual directory in Apache. Having done this before, I was not worried. This time, however, it did not work. After some research, I realized that these directives were in conflict with some mod_rewrite entries that are part of the stack installer. They are:</p>

<p><code>
  ServerName localhost
  RewriteEngine On
  RewriteOptions Inherit
  RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !/acquia-drupal.<em>
  RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !/phpmyadmin.</em>
  RewriteRule ^(/.*)?$ /acquia-drupal$1
</code></p>

<p>In this case, any URI that does not look like http://${hostname}/acquia-drupal is rewritten to match that format. So my URI of http://${hostname}/SampleASP was being rewritten as http://${hostname}/acquia-drupal/SampleASP which does not exist and promptly fails. The solution to this problem was to modify the AspNetMount and Alias entries above to this:</p>

<p> <code>AspNetMount /acquia-drupal/SampleASP "c:/SampleASP"
 Alias /acquia-drupal/SampleASP "c:/SampleASP"</code></p>

<p> This redirected properly and the ASP.NET executed. So, the lesson here is that, if you choose to use a stack installer, make sure you understand the customizations that the installer makes to the products it includes.</p>
