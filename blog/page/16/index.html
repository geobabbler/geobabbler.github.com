  <div class="entry-content"><p>It has been a truism for some time that GIS enables us to build models of the Earth. Esri Press has even offered a book on geodatabase design called ?<a href="http://esripress.esri.com/display/index.cfm?fuseaction=display&amp;websiteID=27">Modeling Our World</a>? for a while. Traditionally, GIS has given us the ability to model the surface of the earth (in a broad sense), including our effect upon it. That can be extended to subsurface modeling and weather modeling and similar concepts but, in general, GIS has focused on the surface of the earth, plus or minus a few thousand meters or so. </div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I was working on an annotation tool for an application I am developing using the <a href="http://help.arcgis.com/en/webapi/silverlight/index.html">Esri Silverlight API</a>. The <a href="http://help.arcgis.com/en/webapi/silverlight/apiref/ESRI.ArcGIS.Client~ESRI.ArcGIS.Client.Symbols.TextSymbol.html">TextSymbol</a> class has properties to specify the X and Y offsets in order to position the text relative to the symbol&#8217;s base point. I needed to calculate the size of the string in order to determine the offset I wanted to use. Silverlight seems to have no intrinsic equivalent to the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/6xe5hazb.aspx">MeasureString function</a> so I hacked this up. </div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>One of the new features included in the latest release of <a href="http://www.geocommons.com">GeoCommons</a> is geocoding. Previous releases have provided the ability to upload non-spatial data (such as CSV files) and walk through a wizard-like interface to join that data with existing spatial data sets already in GeoCommons. This latest release brings the <a href="http://geocommons.com/help/FortiusOne_Geocoder">FortiusOne Geocoder</a> to bear to give you the ability to upload data containing US addresses and generate point locations. In my opinion, this is a very powerful addition to GeoCommons. </div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The <a href="http://www.osgeo.org/gvsig">gvSIG (open-source desktop GIS)</a> project now has a site listing gvSIG implementation case studies. It is available at:</p>

<p><a href="http://casestudies.gvsig.org/">http://casestudies.gvsig.org/</a></p>

<p>A quick perusal of the site shows a few case studies covering a variety of application areas. This type of thing could be a good way to showcase (and market) the power of gvSIG to a wider audience. It looks like you have to fill out a standardized form in order to submit a project, which gives the resulting case studies consistent and fairly clean structure.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s no indication of the acceptance criteria for a case study but it looks like something to keep an eye on for a while.</p>

<p>So, if you&#8217;re a gvSIG user or consultant, then here&#8217;s a place to toot your horn.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So I was walking to the <a href="http://www.esri.com/events/dev-meetup/index.html">Esri Dev Meetup</a> in Arlington, VA with <a href="http://www.maploser.com/">Kate Chapman</a> and <a href="http://www.adamestrada.com">Adam Estrada</a> and we were talking about <a href="http://www.gaia-gis.it/spatialite/">SpatiaLite</a>. Specifically, we were discussing <a href="http://www.spatiallyadjusted.com/2010/09/16/spatialite-is-not-the-shapefile-of-the-future/">James&#8217; recent post</a> and the lack of uptake of SpatiaLite. The really easy thing to do is to lay the blame at the feet of <a href="http://www.esri.com">Esri</a> for not supporting it. But then it occurred to me that Esri hasn&#8217;t succeeded in making the file <a href="http://webhelp.esri.com/arcgisdesktop/9.2/index.cfm?TopicName=Types_of_geodatabases">geodatabase</a> the next shapefile nor did they succeed in making the personal geodatabase the next shapefile. When I think about it, Esri has been trying really hard to kill the shapefile for a long time, without success. </div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>If you?ve been to the <a href="http://pub.obtusesoft.com">Obtuse Software</a> site recently, you may or may not have noticed a change to the ?<a href="http://pub.obtusesoft.com/who.aspx">Who We Are</a>? page. It now lists only <a href="http://abegillespie.blogspot.com">Abe Gillespie</a> and <a href="http://www.paolocorti.net/">Paolo Corti</a>. Prior to my trip to Colorado to talk about zigGIS at <a href="http://www.gisintherockies.org/GISITR2010/Home/Default.aspx">GIS in the Rockies</a>, I informed Abe and Paolo that I would be stepping back from any ?official? involvement in Obtuse.</p>

<p>This does not mean that I am stepping back from involvement in zigGIS. I plan to continue to support zigGIS as it returns to open-source but, in truth, I haven?t done much with zigGIS day-to-day in a long time. As part of the <a href="http://abegillespie.blogspot.com/2010/04/prodigal-extension.html">return of zigGIS to open-source at version 3.0</a>, Abe has been working on a plan to give the community multiple paths to support the project, including sponsorship and technical support plans. I&#8217;m sure he&#8217;ll have the details out soon so I&#8217;ll leave it at that (since it&#8217;s not my story to tell). So, as Obtuse transitions to more of a supporting role for the zigGIS 3.0 open-source project, I felt that this was a good time to step away and become part of the community. </div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Last week marked a couple of firsts for me: it was my first time attending the <a href="http://www.gisintherockies.org/GISITR2010/Home/Default.aspx">GIS in the Rockies</a> conference and also my first time in Northern Colorado. I enjoyed my trip greatly.</p>

<p>First off, the people of Northern Colorado were universally nice. That held true of everyone I met at the conference as well as people at every restaurant, gas station and other establishment I entered. Of course, why not? The countryside is beautiful. For a lifelong resident of the East Coast, the countryside of Northern Colorado represents the stereotypical image I get in my mind when I think of &#8220;the West.&#8221; Driving north from Denver, the plains stretched out on one side as far as I could see while, on the other side, mountains arose as if just &#8220;plopped&#8221; there. All of this under a sky so vast I have really only seen its like back East when driving through the Everglades.</p>

<p>In this setting, I made my way to the conference. This is the first time I&#8217;ve been to such a regional conference. Due to committments at home, I had to fly out Wednesday morning so I did not get to catch <a href="http://twitter.com/pmbatty">Peter Batty&#8217;s</a> <a href="http://www.gisuser.com/content/view/21412/28/">keynote</a>. I did, however, run into <a href="http://twitter.com/briantimoney">Brian Timoney</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/gletham">Glenn Letham</a> rather quickly so I started out with friendly faces. </div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have generally been very happy with <a href="http://www.gisintherockies.org/GISITR2010/Home/Default.aspx">GIS in the Rockies</a> (more on that in another post) as it&#8217;s good to get a look at different uses, concerns and perspectives. This afternoon, I sat through the &#8220;Collaboration Panel&#8221; discussion. The panel was made of of a few people representing state, regional and local governments and well as utilities and academia. Almost uniformly, there was a fear (yes, I mean fear) of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crowdsourcing">crowdsourcing</a> that was best summed up by the following statement:</p>

<blockquote> &#8220;Crowdsourcing presents a vulnerability to us.&#8221;</blockquote>


<p>Thank goodness <a href="http://twitter.com/gletham/status/24679715438">Glenn Letham was sitting there and tweeted it</a> or I might not have believed I heard it. Over the course of the discussion, talk kept returning to the image of &#8220;just anyone&#8221; editing spatial data, opening up potential liability for jurisdictions. Another gem:</p>

<blockquote>&#8220;When everyone is responsible, no one is responsible.&#8221;</blockquote>


<p>I will grant that the entire discussion did not focus on crowdsourcing but it was a topic that was circled back to several times. I was left with a sense that, when these people think of crowdsourcing, they literally picture crowds of the &#8220;great unwashed&#8221; making random edits to critical data sets from there iPhones. Fear, uncertainty and doubt was projected at such a level that it exposed, well, fear, uncertainty and doubt on the part of the panelists.</p>

<p>A great premium was placed on data being collected and managed by &#8220;authoritative&#8221; data providers, who collect data using a set of validated business rules and procedures. Yet a great premium was also placed on getting to the point where such data sets can be freely shared. This exposed to me another issue: a complete lack of understanding of the concept of crowdsourcing.</p>

<p>I realize that, for governments, there can be legal and statutory issues with publicly sharing data sets (the Privacy Act with regard to parcel data, for example) that must be worked through. For this discussion, I will set those aside. The following statement was made late in the session:</p>

<blockquote>&#8220;<a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/">OpenStreetMap</a> will never be an authoritative data source.&#8221;</blockquote>


<p>To that, I offer this (which I could not offer in the session since the floor was not opened):</p>

<p>If you feel you are the &#8220;authoritative&#8221; provider for street data for your region and that you capture that data using vetted procedures and business rules that assure data quality and accuracy <em>and</em> you profess to want to be able to share that data with the public, why don&#8217;t you donate that data to OpenStreetMap so that it would then be providing &#8220;authoritative&#8221; data (or at least data derived from an &#8220;authoritative&#8221; source). People who choose to use OSM for their applications would then be using high-quality data.</p>

<p>Why not, rather than tear down the concept, engage and participate, provide the model for how to do so and demonstrate leadership? In other words&#8230;</p>

<p>Be the crowd!</p>

I booked my flight a while ago but I had been procrastinating on the hotel and rental car. This will be my first time in that part of Colorado so I am looking forward to seeing the area and meeting people out there. NoCo is second only to the DC area in clustering of folks in my Twitter crowd.</div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I am seeing a bit of a bump in traffic from the &#8221;<a href="http://www.onlineengineeringdegree.org/50-best-blogs-for-geography-geeks">50 Best Blogs for Geography Geeks</a>&#8221; list that hit the interwebs yesterday. I don&#8217;t usually pay much attention to such lists but I do recognize that they can be useful &#8220;one-stop&#8221; resources for people who are just getting started with geospatial tools. That said, this list caught my attention more for some of the blogs that were not included than for those that were.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/img/09-07/0908sign.jpg" /></p>

<p>If you are here because my blog was listed there (the list was also blogged by <a href="http://mapperz.blogspot.com/2010/09/50-best-blogs-for-geography-geeks.html">Mapperz</a>), here are a few notable geospatially-oriented blogs that I was surprised to find omitted from that list. These are blogs I consider resources and inspirations for my work/explorations/musings. I strongly recommend checking them out. They are listed in no particular order.</p>
