  <div class="entry-content"><p>This week, I attended the first-ever <a href="http://www.esri.com">Esri</a> <a href="http://www.esri.com/events/devsummit-dc">DC DevSummit</a> which followed the <a href="http://www.esri.com/events/federal">Federal GIS Conference</a> (please switch it back to &#8220;FedUC&#8221;). This event, intended and a smaller, Federally-focused, companion to the annual Palm Springs DevSummit, came together quickly but was very well-attended with about 300 attendees.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"> <img src="/images/posts/devsummit.jpg" /></p>

<p>It was interesting to note that the most well-attended sessions of the day had to do with Javascript (every Javascript session had over 100 participants). As more and more organizations update their IT infrastructures, the acceleration away from plug-ins seems to be picking up pace. The most common refrain amongst attendees in that regard is that continued standardization on IE8 remains the biggest impediment to sunsetting things like Flex and Silverlight, but the logjam seems to be starting to break loose.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I don&#8217;t usually cross-pollinate between this, my personal blog, and the company blog over at <a href="http://www.zekiah.com">Zekiah</a>. One of the great things about working at a place like Zekiah, however, is the opportunity to work with smart people and see what they are doing. At times, my colleagues will share components of their work on the company blog. We encourage this, and the experimentation that leads to the posts, as a way to keep our technical capabilities fresh and to also showcase what we do in a way that goes beyond the typical capabilities statements that exist on every site. My colleagues have been pretty busy but have managed to take some time to write a few posts about their work:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.zekiah.com/index.php?q=blog/2014/02/04/esri-cityengine-unity-40-and-oculus-rift">Esri CityEngine, Unity 4.0 and the Oculus Rift</a> - My colleague, <a href="http://twitter.com/DanEntzian">Dan Entzian</a>, is an avid gamer, a great developer, and a smart GIS guy. This post combines those interests by showing how to bring cities created in Esri&#8217;s <a href="http://www.esri.com/software/cityengine/">CityEngine</a> into gaming environments like <a href="http://unity3d.com/">Unity</a> and integrate them with the <a href="http://www.oculusvr.com/">Oculus Rift</a> virtual reality display. It&#8217;s a quick, but detailed, read that shows the interactions possible between geospatial tools and games.</li>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The 2014 installment of the <a href="http://www.esri.com/events/federal">Esri Federal GIS Conference</a> (formerly known as the Federal User Conference) happens next week. I have attended the event off and on since its inception. While I originally was drawn by the presence of a large geo-related event in my local area, that gap has been filled by numerous, smaller events from various sources in the past few years. The FedUC has traditionally had something of an identity crisis, with the content often feeling a bit diffuse and somewhat rushed over its quick, two-day schedule.</p>

<p>To Esri&#8217;s credit, and probably in recognition of the changing economics regarding travel for Federal employees, they have continued to fine-tune the event when they could have easily walked away from it. The main problem with the FedUC is the fact that the Federal Government performs a wide array of functions that are difficult to cover well over two days in a conventional format. Esri has tackled that problem this year with the introduction of <a href="http://www.esri.com/events/federal/agenda/immersion-summits">&#8220;immersion summits,&#8221;</a> which are three-and-a-half hour sessions dedicated to specific domain areas.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In my work supporting various aspects of geospatial data modeling, I&#8217;ve spent a lot of time delving into concepts around configuration management of such data models. We&#8217;ve been able to apply a core tool set to perform various functions such as version managment, profiling, version-to-version migration, and validation in conjunction with a system we call the platform independent model (PIM). I gave quick overview of the PIM <a href="http://www.zekiah.com/index.php?q=blog/2014/01/02/generating-physical-schemas-pim">in this post over on the Zekiah blog</a> and the complete series on it <a href="http://www.zekiah.com/index.php?q=blog/topics/pim">can be found here</a>.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve recently spent a bit of time consolidating code after a recent data delivery and decided to post a utility that was an outgrowth of that effort: <a href="https://github.com/Zekiah/ArcGISCompare">a tool to compare schemas of two Esri file geodatabases and report differences</a>. This lent itself to general use because it does not require any connection to a PIM.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&#8220;Never make predictions, especially about the future.&#8221; - Casey Stengel</p>

<p>A few days ago, my friend <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=8637855">Atanas Entchev</a> asked me for <a href="http://geohipster.com/2013/12/31/what-will-be-hot-in-geo-in-2014-predictions-from-the-geohipster-crowd/">my thoughts on coming trends in 2014</a> for a feature he was preparing for his <a href="http://geohipster.com/">GeoHipster</a> site. Being the obliging sort that I am, I provided a couple and I&#8217;ve been attempting to explain one ever since. This has mostly been back-channel via private messages and such but, today, the GeoHipster piece was the subject of the &#8220;#geowebchat&#8221; on Twitter. Twitter is very effective for some types of communication but quickly goes off the rails where nuance or anything long-form is required. So, it was time for a post. My prediction went like this:</p>

<blockquote><p>I think 2014 will be the year Javascript takes over mapping and visualization in the geospatial world.</p></blockquote>

<p>It was followed by an apparently too brief explanation that I will attempt to expand here.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As we enter the final hours of 2013, I wanted to take the chance to thank everyone who stopped by, and continues to stop by, this blog. I appreciate your readership, comments, and feedback. Even after 7 years, I am still humbled by the fact that so many read this blog each year. I decided to take a look at the top ten posts from this year, according to Google Analytics.</p>

</ol>


<p>When I took a look at the list above, I realized that I have been much more focused on data than I have in past years. I think I kept a development/integration flavor but the focus on data was quite noticeable in retrospect. Though I have been actively coding all year, I notice that I did not have as many code-focused posts, which is something of a departure from previous years. 2014 is already shaping up to be a busy year personally and professionally so it will be interesting to see where that leads me on this blog.</p>

<p>Thanks again for your continued interest and I hope you have a fruitful 2014.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I got word today that <a href="http://www.esri.com">Esri</a> is planning a one-day [Developer Summit] in conjunction with the <a href="http://www.esri.com/events/federal/">2014 Federal GIS Conference</a>. It appears that the DevSummit will happen on the Wednesday immediately following the Fed Conference (which runs on the Monday and Tuesday) and will be focused on the issues and challenges that are unique to developing applications with Esri technologies for the Federal Government. I spoke with <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/jdbarry">Jim Barry</a>, who told me the DevSummit has come together rather quickly and Esri hasn&#8217;t had time to do its usual data gathering to prepare for such an event. As a result, they are canvassing the developer community for input on topics they should cover. Here are some things I suggested:</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><strong>UPDATE (12 March 2014):</strong> The situation with JS.GEO 2014 seems to be a bit fluid and the information originally posted here is no longer accurate. As indicated by Steve Citron-Pousty, the current goal is to have the event occur with <a href="https://2014.foss4g.org">FOSS4G in Portland</a>, though that does not appear to have been finalized. In short, don&#8217;t book travel yet.</p>

<p>Information about the follow-up to last year&#8217;s <a href="http://www.jsgeo.org/">JS.Geo</a> event has been percolating back-channel for a few weeks now. <del>Now some <a href="http://lanyrd.com/2014/jsgeo14/">official details have been posted</a>. This year&#8217;s event will be held in April in San Francisco</del>. I attended last year&#8217;s session, really liked the focused format, and got a lot of good information out of it. One thing that was nice was that, regardless of whether you are of an Esri or open-source persuasion in your development preferences, there was a lot of good information presented with a relative lack of hyperbole, which made it easy to focus on the content.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><strong>tl;dr</strong></p>

<p>This post describes the construction of a simple, lightweight geospatial data service using Node.JS, PostGIS and Amazon RDS. It is somewhat lengthy and includes a number of code snippets. The post is primarily targeted at users who may be interested in alternative strategies for publishing geospatial data but may not be familiar with the tools discussed here. This effort is ongoing and follow-up posts can be expected.</p>

<p><strong>Rationale</strong></p>

<p>I&#8217;m always looking for opportunities to experiment with new tools and the announcement of PostgreSQL/PostGIS support on Amazon RDS piqued my curiosity. Over the past six months, I have run into the repeated need on a couple of projects to be able to get the bounding box of various polygon features in order to drive dynamic mapping displays. Additionally, the required spatial references of these projects have varied beyond WGS84 and Web Mercator.</p>

<p>With that, the seeds of a geodata service were born. I decided to build one that would, via a simple HTTP call, return the bounding box of a polygon or the polygon itself, in the spatial reference of my choice as a single GeoJSON feature.</p>

<p>I knew I wanted to use PostGIS hosted on Amazon RDS to store my data. Here are the rest of the building blocks for this particular application:</p>

<ol>
<li><a href="http://nodejs.org">Node.js</a></li>
<li>Express web application framework for Node</li>
<li>PG module for accessing PostgreSQL with Node</li>
<li>Natural Earth 1:10M country boundaries</li>
</ol>

He was clearly a behaviorist and was convinced that you could completely condition the instinct to go straight to the food bowl out of the cat. To my knowledge, this professor did not own a cat and never attempted to test his assertion.</p>

<p>I was reminded of this after reading my friend Atanas Entchev&#8217;s <a href="http://blog.entchev.com/2013/11/22/some-post-postgis-day-thoughts.aspx">post in reaction</a> to the <a href="http://postgis.net">PostGIS</a> Day <a href="http://www.spatiallyadjusted.com/2013/11/21/todays-hangout-postgis-day-extravaganza-panel/">hangout panel discussion</a>. In his post, <a href="http://twiiter.com/atanas">Atanas</a> describes difficulty in convincing customers to consider open-source geospatial tools. These customers and prospects are comfortable with their proprietary tools and associated workflows and are reluctant to consider switching. I have encountered this attitude many times myself so I take no issue with the observation. Barriers to exit are real considerations, regardless of the new technology being considered. Organizations align themselves around their tools to achieve maximum efficiency with them. I discussed these issues at a talk I gave last year to the <a href="https://njgin.state.nj.us/OIT_NJGF/index.jsp">New Jersey Geospatial Forum</a> about how organizations can extend their existing geospatial technology investments with open-source technologies. These issues are very real for any organization with a mature, extended investment in a particular technology stack.</p>

<p>Atanas went on to liken the attitude to that with which some people view alternative medicine and I can see his point. Traditional GIS has set itself apart from the rest of the technology world for so long that users are generally conditioned to believe that GIS workflows should involve a series of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rube_Goldberg">Rube Goldberg</a> machinations involving file-based data sets, some proprietary scripting, and possibly some application-level business logic to relate and/or join data as necessary. This has taken various forms over the years but diagrams of those workflows tend to look the same.</p>
