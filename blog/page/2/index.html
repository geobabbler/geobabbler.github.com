  <div class="entry-content"><p>In 2011, I gave a talk at the NCGIS conference about the continued dominance of the desktop in the world of GIS. In that talk, my main point was that, regardless of the ultimate destination of GIS data or maps (cloud, server, paper, PDF, etc.), most GIS data passes through a desktop GIS at some point. I don&#8217;t have hard data to back up that claim but I think anyone who has worked in the industry for any length of time will agree that it feels right. If we loosely define &#8220;desktop GIS&#8221; to include not only GUI analytical tools like <a href="http://www.esri.com">ArcMap</a> or <a href="http://qgis.org">QGIS</a>, but also command-line tools such as <a href="http://www.gdal.org/">GDAL/OGR</a> and cartographic tools such as <a href="https://www.mapbox.com/tilemill/">TileMill</a>, I think the statement is even more comfortable.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><iframe width="560" height="420" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/ljIQo1OHkTI?color=white&theme=light"></iframe></p>

<p>Essentially, my claim was that desktop GIS is still the onramp for most of the data we interact with on the web. Over the past few years, geographically tagged live and temporally-sensitive data streams have increased in importance but I think most geospatial data still starts as traditional data sources (rasters, vectors, terrain, etc.) that pass through a desktop for analysis, processing, and styling before moving on to the web. Esri, for example, still features its desktop tools as prominent parts of its web publishing workflow and <a href="http://boundlessgeo.com/">Boundless</a> is working on a <a href="https://github.com/boundlessgeo/suite-qgis-plugin">similar path for QGIS</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It&#8217;s great news that the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/house-effort-to-end-fiscal-crisis-collapses-leaving-senate-to-forge-last-minute-solution/2013/10/16/1e8bb150-364d-11e3-be86-6aeaa439845b_story.html?hpid=z1">government shutdown is finally over</a>. Many of our colleagues across the geospatial industry can now report back to work, ending a another stressful period for them. During the shutdown, many stepped up to try and fill the gap left by shuttered government web sites that would normally distribute geospatial data.</p>

<p>Among those who stepped into the breach are my friends at <a href="http://www.weogeo.com">WeoGeo</a>, who told me they saw a huge uptick in traffic as the community realized that government data sets such as TIGER and DRG are freely available in the <a href="http://market.weogeo.com/">WeoGeo Market</a>. One of the capabilities that has been quietly introduced into WeoGeo&#8217;s platform over the last few days is the ability to extract and download TIGER and OSM data directly in <a href="http://geojson.org">GeoJSON</a> format. The embedded video by WeoGeo walks through the customization and ordering process better than I can, but it&#8217;s great to have the ability to extract fine-tuned data sets directly in GeoJSON format for use in modern web-mapping tools.</p>

<p>Static content has been making a comeback lately, and justifiably so. The truth is that most of the content we interact with on the web won&#8217;t change over time and complex content management systems (CMS) that dynamically generate HTML and such from databases on every call are really overkill. Sure, there are caching strategies and CDNs and such to hide some of the misery but you can&#8217;t beat the speed, simplicity, and scalability of static content.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It&#8217;s been a pretty good week for us at <a href="http://www.zekiah.com">Zekiah</a>. We announced two new <a href="http://www.zekiah.com/index.php?q=press/2013/09/16/zekiah-technologies-inc-wins-marine-corps-logistics-support-services-mclogss-contra">contract</a> <a href="http://www.zekiah.com/index.php?q=press/2013/09/16/zekiah-technologies-inc-awarded-contract-mission-assurance-division">wins</a> and I&#8217;m pleased to say that we&#8217;re not done yet. After final paperwork is done, we should be able to announce a couple more. These are the things that make small-business ownership worthwhile: doing good work, building relationships with our customers and then leveraging our track record to be able to work with new customers. Project execution and business development help us build the foundation necessary to be a good place for our employees to work and we try hard every day to make sure that we are such a place.</p>

<p>The second contract win we announced this week, with the US Navy&#8217;s Mission Assurance Division in Dahlgren, Virginia, is particularly fulfilling for us because we have worked side-by-side with that organization since the late 1990&#8217;s, doing challenging work in the areas of infrastructure protection and situational awareness during that time. We have literally grown and evolved alongside them over that time.</p>

<p>I typically try not to mix my blog with the daily operational aspects of my work at Zekiah. Usually, my work comes through in abstracted form in various posts, although many posts actually reflect my own personal experimentation and side projects. I&#8217;m stepping outside of that practice today to say that our latest contract win has given us <a href="http://www.zekiah.com/index.php?q=careers/openings/gis-software-developer-ii">an opening for a software developer</a> to come work with us at the Mission Assurance Division.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A year ago, I used the StackExchange API to facilitate an <a href="http://blog.geomusings.com/2012/09/13/carving-up-gis-stackexchange/">analysis of tags on GIS StackExchange</a> to see what people were talking about on one of the largest and most successful vendor-neutral discussion sites in our industry. In that post, I stated &#8220;It would probably be good to revisit this in a year to see how things have changed, if at all.&#8221;</p>

<p>Well, a year has passed so I decided to do it again. I used the same scripts and approach I used last time in order to be consistent. Since this is one year later, there is one key caveat. My analysis last year looked at the top 100 tags since the start of the <a href="http://gis.stackexchange.com/">GIS StackExchange</a> site. Since I ran the same query this year, the new results are compounded so what they so are last year&#8217;s results plus activity since then. Essentially, you are looking at &#8220;that plus this.&#8221; The pie chart below shows the breakdown.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It&#8217;s been a while since I&#8217;ve posted as the usual wind-down of summer and wind-up of the school year has had me otherwise engaged. What follows are few developments over the past few months that have floated through the transom of my geo-awareness.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://daylightdonutsstier.com/assets/images/slideshow/CakeDonuts.jpg" height="50%" width="50%"/></p>

<p><a href="http://geojson.io/">geojson.io</a> - Remember all of the attention given to the ability to render GitHub-hosted GeoJSON files as maps? Well, <a href="http://twitter.com/tmcw">Tom MacWright</a> of <a href="http://mapbox.com">MapBox</a> has, in fairly rapid fashion, given us this tool to edit GeoJSON in the browser and publish to either a GitHub repo or a gist. It&#8217;s an easy-to-use tool with an interface consistent with other MapBox tools. It&#8217;s definitely worth checking out and adds an important piece of workflow to the GeoJSON-on-GitHub concept.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h2>TL;DR:</h2>

<p>In which, as a result of a <a href="http://blog.entchev.com/2013/08/08/gis-blogging-in-decline.aspx">post by Atanas Entchev</a>, I postulate on why I continue to do this blog thing. This is a departure from my typical subject matter and you can be forgiven for not reading any further.</p>

<hr />

<p>My friend <a href="http://twitter.com/atanas">Atanas Entchev&#8217;s</a> <a href="http://blog.entchev.com/2013/08/08/gis-blogging-in-decline.aspx">latest post</a> on a possible decline in GIS blogging got me looking at my own output. After and initial surge, I have held steady at 40 to 45 posts per year. The discussion around Atanas&#8217; post, both in his blog comments and on his <a href="https://plus.google.com/110319601981109631300/posts/A3twyjrs8yL">Google+ stream</a>, got me thinking about why I continue to do this. So, at the risk of being accused of engaging in philosophical navel-gazing, here it goes.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="/images/posts/posts.png" /></p>

<p>This blog was not my first attempt at blogging. I originally had an <a href="http://www.esri.com">ESRI</a>-development focused blog on Blogger in about 2004. I think I made four or five posts, let it languish for a bit, and then killed it off. The main reason for that is that I wasn&#8217;t really sure what I was trying to accomplish with a blog. I never even backed it up so whatever was there is lost to the ages.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>With the release of ArcGIS 10.2, <a href="http://www.esri.com">Esri</a> quietly added support for <a href="https://sqlite.org/">SQLite</a> as a geodatabase container. This is big news as the community has been looking for such support for some time. An open-source RDBMS originally designed for embedded systems, SQLite has a very small footprint and is <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/mostdeployed.html">arguably the most widely deployed RDBMS</a> in the world. (Thanks, in part, to the fact that it is embedded into Adobe Reader and other commonly used software.) Over the years numerous strategies for storing spatial data in SQLite have been developed, ranging from simply storing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-known_text">WKT or WKB</a> geometries in a column up to full extensions like <a href="http://www.gaia-gis.it/gaia-sins/">SpatiaLite</a>, which adds OGC-compliant data types and methods. SQLite is also the engine that drives the popular <a href="http://www.mapbox.com/developers/mbtiles/">MBTiles</a> implementation used by <a href="http://www.mapbox.com/tilemill/">TileMill</a> and <a href="http://www.mapbox.com">MapBox</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There has been a bit of buzz the past couple of weeks over the <a href="https://github.com/blog/1541-geojson-rendering-improvements">ability of GitHub to render GeoJSON and TopoJSON files</a> automatically using  and embedded <a href="http://leafletjs.com/">Leaflet</a> map and <a href="http://www.mapbox.com/">MapBox</a> technology. This buzz is quite justified as it presents an easy way to simply publish and visualize vector data sets. In the weeks since the initial announcement, the community has begun exploring the limits of GitHub&#8217;s capability. Probably the two biggest limiting factors are individual file size limits and API rate limits. Some, including myself, are exploring strategies for maximizing the ability to store, disseminate, and visualize data within these confines. For the near term, <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> will probably not be the place to store terabytes of data or act as the CDN for a high-volume mapping application. That is perfectly fine and there is still a great deal of value to be found within GitHub&#8217;s current generous constraints.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="/images/posts/geodata-git.png" /></p>

<p>One aspect of GitHub (really, its underlying <a href="http://git-scm.com/">git</a> engine) that is of great interest to me is the ability to perform version control and configuration management on data itself. With GitHub, that currently takes the form of text-based formats such as JSON but it&#8217;s a start. In my experience supporting various customers over the years, configuration management of data has been a common gap in information operations. The most common, and inadequate, approach to this problem has been through the use of metadata. Almost two decades of viewing out-of-date, incomplete, and inaccurate metadata has given the lie to this approach. Metadata represents a separate maintenance workflow for which many organizations simply do not dedicate resources. Data-set-level metadata is also inadequate for volatile data sets in which individual records are updated frequently.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>While the majority of the geospatial world was at the Esri International User Conference in San Diego last week, I was at a different conference in Orlando, Florida. This was my third time attending the Children with Diabetes (CWD) <a href="http://www.childrenwithdiabetes.com/activities/orlando2013/">Friends for Life</a> (FFL) conference and I&#8217;ll be there as often as I can for the foreseeable future. It&#8217;s beneficial in many obvious ways; enabling us to keep up with the latest developments in diabetes research and technologies as well as keeping us refreshed in terms of diabetes management best practices.</p>

<p>The unexpected thing for me over the years has been how the lessons I&#8217;ve learned at FFL have begun to translate into other aspects of life outside of diabetes. (I do not have diabetes myself but I am a parent of a person who does.)  This year, perhaps because the ongoing Esri UC was somewhere in the back of my mind, it provided a different lens through which to view my approach to my professional activities.</p>

<p>The content at FFL is varied. Some touches on leading edge work in the field of biological treatments such as the <a href="http://www.diabetesresearch.org/BioHub">Diabetes Research Institute&#8217;s BioHub</a> as well as mechanical/electronic treatments such as the <a href="http://artificialpancreasproject.com/">Artificial Pancreas Project</a>. Other content touches upon achieving more effective day-to-day management using current techniques such as insulin pumps, shots, carbohydrate counting and the like.</p>

<p>The conference includes many pharmaceutical companies offering competing products, differing lines of research that stand a chance of superseding one another, representatives of government agencies, insurance companies and advocacy groups that can have very adversarial relationships. Yet FFL has an overwhelmingly positive tone. This because everyone is focused on one goal: the elimination of diabetes. Any approach that represents a step toward that goal is cheered by all, as is any technique that eases the burden of living with diabetes in the meantime. Ultimately, the various technologies showcased at the conference help facilitate progress toward this goal but the technologies are not the point.</p>

<p>Let me say that again.</p>

<p><strong>The technologies are not the point.</strong></p>
