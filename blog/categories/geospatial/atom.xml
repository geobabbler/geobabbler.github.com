    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I'm looking forward to next week's <a href="http://geojs.eventbrite.com/">JS.geo</a> event in Denver. It is a small event, spearheaded by <a href="http://twitter.com/cwhelm">Chris Helm</a> of <a href="http://www.esri.com">Esri</a>, that focuses on the use of Javascript in geospatial applications. Although I have been more vocal in my <a href="http://blog.geomusings.com/blog/categories/python/">recent explorations with Python</a>, I've probably done as much, if not more, work with Javascript over the past 18 months.</p>

<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://mapbrief.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/no_plugin.jpg" /></div>


<p>The pace of innovation with Javascript in the geospatial area has been staggering. It seems like only a short time ago that the options for working with geospatial applications were <a href="http://openlayers.org/">OpenLayers</a> and the <a href="http://help.arcgis.com/en/webapi/javascript/arcgis/">Esri Javascript API</a>. The rapid advent of tools such as <a href="http://www.geoext.org/">GeoExt</a>, <a href="http://leafletjs.com/">Leaflet</a>, and many others has really lead to a explosion of capability. Of course, the recent buzz has been about <a href="http://d3js.org/">D3</a>, which tackles a wide rangle of data visualization problems, including geo. D3 is of particular interest because it is tackling the issue of projection in the browser, freeing applications from the dominance of Web Mercator.</p>

<p>Of course, it's not been all about the browser, either as <a href="http://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a> has made abundantly clear. One of the most effective desktop applications for cartographic design, <a href="http://mapbox.com/tilemill/">TileMill</a>, is built with Node, among other tools.</p>

<p>The maturity of Javascript as a tool for geospatial development is such that I am at the point that, if it weren't for government customers that are <a href="http://mapbrief.com/2011/10/13/web-mapping-continues-to-pay-for-the-sins-of-internet-explorer/">still standardized on Internet Explorer 8</a> or older, a plug-in-based environment would not be my first choice for a new application.</p>

<p>As for the JS.geo event itself, I am intrigued by its small, focused nature. It doesn't seem to be as informal as an unconference but may be easier to digest than the typical geo event. It will also be great to catch up with the Front Range crowd.</p>

    <updated>2011-04-29T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.geomusings.com/2011/04/29/arkansas-evaluating-geospatial-cloud-infrastructures</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.zekiah.com">My company</a> has recently begun working on a project for the Arkansas Geographic Information Office (AGIO) to evaluate options for potentially migrating the <a href="http://www.geostor.arkansas.gov/G6/Home.html">GeoStor</a> geospatial infrastructure to a cloud computing environment. If you are unfamiliar with GeoStor, it is the official geospatial platform for the State of Arkansas and is maintained by AGIO. I realize, as does AGIO, that "the cloud" has become a buzzword that has lost any meaningful context. So, for purposes of discussion, we'll go with the NIST draft definition available here: <a href="http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/drafts/800-145/Draft-SP-800-145_cloud-definition.pdf">http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/drafts/800-145/Draft-SP-800-145_cloud-definition.pdf</a>.</p>

<p>For this effort, we are open to considering any service model but we have strict guidance that the only deployment model of interest is the public cloud model.<!--more--></p>

<p>We are currently engaged in developing a detailed characterization of the current state of GeoStor (software, hardware, support, staffing), its user base and the products and services it provides. From there, we will derive the functional capabilities that are employed by GeoStor and would need to be supported in a new architecture.</p>

<p>At that point, we will distribute a survey so that interested vendors may assess the ability of their products to meet those requirements. We have been directed to "cast the net wide" so as not to miss out on potentially compelling solutions. After some discussion, we decided a post such as this may be a good way to kick off the process.</p>

<p><img alt="The floodgates are open" src="http://verizonvoyager.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/flood-gates-550x412.jpg" /></p>

<p>So, if you feel you have a product/service/solution that you would like considered and would like to receive this survey, please send the following information to me by e-mail (<a href="mailto:bill@zekiah.com?subject=GeoStor Survey">bill@zekiah.com</a>):</p>

<ul>
    <li>Your company name</li>

    <li>Name of the relevant point of contact within your company</li>

    <li>E-mail address of the point of contact</li>

    <li>Phone number of the point of contact</li>
</ul>


<p>We realize that we may be opening the floodgates with this but we also feel, given the volatile nature of this space, that more information is better than less. That said, here are a few guidelines:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Please do not attempt to contact me, my company or AGIO about this effort other than to send the information requested above. We are quite busy with characterization efforts and cannot take time away from that to answer questions. The nature of the GeoStor requirements will be evident from the survey.</li>
    <li>This post, the survey or any activity related to it should not be construed as a request for proposal or an intent to engage in a procurement or acquisition of any kind. This is strictly a market survey activity.</li>
    <li>My company is acting solely as a consultant and cannot represent AGIO in any official capacity. No communication from me or my company, including this post, should be considered a representation of the intent or positions of AGIO in any way.</li>
</ul>

    <id>http://blog.geomusings.com/2011/04/28/wherecampdc-is-set</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I just learned from <a href="http://twitter.com/wonderchook">Kate Chapman</a> that the date for <a href="http://wherecampdc.org/">WhereCampDC</a> has been set. It will be Saturday, June 11th. If you are interested in attending, you can register through EventBrite <a href="http://wherecampdc.eventbrite.com/">here</a>. Move fast because it'll probably fill up quickly!</p>

<p>Despite all the of geospatial activity in this region, there has been a dearth of conference activity. The <a href="http://www.esri.com/events/feduc/index.html">Esri FedUC</a> has been the only game in town for years so WhereCampDC is a welcome addition to the scene. Also, the very structured conference environment around here could stand a little injection of "un" into its veins. :)</p>

<p>Oh yeah, there'll be lightning talks on the 10th, too!</p>

<p>See you there!</p>
