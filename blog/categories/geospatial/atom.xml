    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday, I attended the <a href="http://geojs.eventbrite.com/">JS.geo</a> conference at the Colorado University Denver campus. It looked like about 100 or so came out for the event. I was able to catch up with <a href="http://twitter.com/cwhelm">Chris Helm</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/briantimoney">Brian Timoney</a> the night before and they told me the event took off faster than they had originally expected. I think this speaks to two things: 1) the level of interest in Javascript as a solution for geospatial applications and 2) the fast pace of innovation in the Javascript community that has a lot of people looking for ways to stay abreast of the latest developments.</p>

<p>What follows is an overview based on some of the notes I took. I wasn't always writing as I sometimes just stopped to listen and I'll probably follow up with more details later.</p>

<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://blog.geomusings.com/images/posts/jsgeo13.png" /></div>


<p>Data reduction was strong current running under the day. With the rise of newer libraries that enable more sophisticated capabilities in the browser, there is increased recognition of the need to reduce the amount of data passing over the wire. For geometry, <a href="https://github.com/mbostock/topojson">TopoJSON</a> is getting a lot of attention here. It delivers topologically correct data which reduces data by removing redundant geometry such coincident arcs between polygons and such. The output reminds me of an old <a href="http://www.gdal.org/ogr/drv_avcbin.html">ARC/INFO coverage</a> and is providing stunning results in reducing the size of geometries when compared to <a href="http://geojson.org">GeoJSON</a> or Esri JSON. <a href="http://twitter.com/andrewxhill">Andrew Hill</a> of <a href="http://vizzuality.com">Vizzuality</a> mentioned that <a href="http://cartodb.com">CartoDB</a> currently has support for TopoJSON in staging. He also discussed strategies they use to reduce the size of feature and attribute data. This "data cubing" strategy turns out to similar to approaches that are commonplace in the financial industry. This serves as a reminder to look around and see what others are doing to solve similar problems.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>One a related note, the reduction of application code being delivered to the browser is also a focus. This was probably best illustrated by <a href="http://twitter.com/mattpriour">Matt Priour's</a> talk on <a href="http://openlayers.org">OpenLayers</a>. The fact that there are now three builds (full, mobile, light) as well as a focus on being more modular in version 3. <a href="http://twitter.com/pmbatty">Peter Batty</a>, in his demo of <a href="http://www.ubisense.net/en/">Ubisense</a>, made a good case for intelligent balance between server-side and client-side processing to achieve good performance.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.khronos.org/webgl/">WebGL</a> got a lot of attention from a number of speakers, with <a href="http://twitter.com/brendankenny">Brendan Kenny</a> of Google showing work he has done, including a Javascript port of GLUTessellation. Jeremy Bartley of Esri gave a lightning talk about <a href="http://www.esri.com/software/cityengine">CityEngine</a>, which is based on WebGL. WebGL is widely seen as the open solution to graphics performance that may finally kill the need for plug-ins. In side discussions, Jeremy talked about how WebGL will figure more into the previously discussed data reduction problem. The reality is that both servers and clients are getting much better at handling large data sets but the same can't necessarily be said for the wires that connect them.</p>

<p>GeoJSON continues to get a lot of love. It continues to be, in my opinion, the motor oil for the engine that is web mapping. It will be interesting see how the separation of concerns between GeoJSON and TopoJSON evolves, but I think GeoJSON will continue to be an important syntax.</p>

<p>While the majority of the discussion focused on browsers, <a href="http://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a> got significant attention. <a href="http://twitter.com/willwhitedc">Will White</a> of <a href="http://mapbox.com">MapBox</a> gave a good talk about the evolution of Node and the advantages of its non-blocking I/O model. One statistic he gave was surprising: he said 6 of the top 12 contributors on GitHub are Node contributors. That speaks loudly to the rapid evolution of Node as well as the interest in Javascript. Will put out a call to the geospatial community to build out the geospatial capabilities of Node. Later in the day, we saw a good lightning talk that showed Node processing real-time data and feeding a number of D3 visualizations.</p>

<p>While Matt Priour and <a href="https://twitter.com/atogle">Aaron Ogle</a> opened with great talks on OpenLayers and <a href="http://leafletjs.com/">Leaflet</a>, respectively, the clear star of the client-side show was <a href="http://d3js.org/">D3</a> (although Aaron's walkshed analysis in Leaflet was cool). There were lots of great visualizations (as well as nods to TopoJSON). While the D3's support for projections is getting a lot of attention from geospatial developers, I am more interested in its holistic approach to data visualization. In D3, geo is one way to look at data, but not the central way. Because of this, D3 provides an integrated capability to have multiple data visualizations in an application without overloading with a ton of libraries.</p>

<p>I am already well past tl;dr on this post and I have to catch a plane. Many of the URL talks were great but I'll follow up with some more details. All-in-all, I think the event was quite a success and I'm glad I came.</p>

    <link href="http://blog.geomusings.com/2013/01/09/comment-period-open-for-geopackage-specification-draft/"/>
    <updated>2013-01-09T06:15:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.geomusings.com/2013/01/09/comment-period-open-for-geopackage-specification-draft</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) has <a href="http://www.opengeospatial.org/pressroom/pressreleases/1756">published a draft GeoPackage specification for comment</a>. The GeoPackage specification attempts to create a non-proprietary means for packaging and exchanging all geospatial data in all its forms (vector, raster, and tiles). A couple of things that jump out at me:</p>

<ul>
<li>It calls out <a href="https://sqlite.org/">SQLite</a> as the reference implementation of a GeoPackage container</li>
<li>It calls out <a href="http://www.gaia-gis.it/gaia-sins/">SpatiaLite</a> 4 as the reference implementation of a vector feature store</li>
<li>It does not call out a reference implementation for rasters or tiles</li>
<li>It does not mention exchange of cartography.</li>
</ul>


<!--more-->


<p>Although the draft references the <a href="http://mapbox.com/developers/mbtiles/">MBTiles</a> specification and uses it as an example of a pure SQL method of storing tiles, it does not call out MBTiles as the chosen storage approach nor does it mention MBTiles as a reference implementation. The draft should not be read as "SpatiaLite + MBTiles."</p>

<div style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://www.publicdomainpictures.net/view-image.php?image=9097&picture=empty-cardboard-boxes"><img src="http://blog.geomusings.com/images/posts/boxes.png" /></a></div>


<p>I think, in 2013, anything that attempts to do what GeoPackage sets out to do should have some provision for cartography. I would prefer CSS-like approach (such as <a href="http://mapbox.com/tilemill/docs/manual/carto/">CartoCSS</a>) and will say so when I submit comments but I would suspect that future discussion of cartography, if any, will probably start with SLD. For now, tiles can fill the gap.</p>

<p>So comments are open, give it a look and tell OGC what you think.</p>

    <link href="http://blog.geomusings.com/2013/01/08/getting-ready-for-js-dot-geo/"/>
    <updated>2013-01-08T15:50:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.geomusings.com/2013/01/08/getting-ready-for-js-dot-geo</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I'm looking forward to next week's <a href="http://geojs.eventbrite.com/">JS.geo</a> event in Denver. It is a small event, spearheaded by <a href="http://twitter.com/cwhelm">Chris Helm</a> of <a href="http://www.esri.com">Esri</a>, that focuses on the use of Javascript in geospatial applications. Although I have been more vocal in my <a href="http://blog.geomusings.com/blog/categories/python/">recent explorations with Python</a>, I've probably done as much, if not more, work with Javascript over the past 18 months.</p>

<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://mapbrief.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/no_plugin.jpg" /></div>


<p>The pace of innovation with Javascript in the geospatial area has been staggering. It seems like only a short time ago that the options for working with geospatial applications were <a href="http://openlayers.org/">OpenLayers</a> and the <a href="http://help.arcgis.com/en/webapi/javascript/arcgis/">Esri Javascript API</a>. The rapid advent of tools such as <a href="http://www.geoext.org/">GeoExt</a>, <a href="http://leafletjs.com/">Leaflet</a>, and many others has really lead to a explosion of capability. Of course, the recent buzz has been about <a href="http://d3js.org/">D3</a>, which tackles a wide range of data visualization problems, including geo. D3 is of particular interest because it is tackling the issue of projection in the browser, freeing applications from the dominance of Web Mercator.</p>

<p>Of course, it's not been all about the browser, either as <a href="http://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a> has made abundantly clear. One of the most effective desktop applications for cartographic design, <a href="http://mapbox.com/tilemill/">TileMill</a>, is built with Node, among other tools.</p>

<p>The maturity of Javascript as a tool for geospatial development is such that I am at the point that, if it weren't for government customers that are <a href="http://mapbrief.com/2011/10/13/web-mapping-continues-to-pay-for-the-sins-of-internet-explorer/">still standardized on Internet Explorer 8</a> or older, a plug-in-based environment would not be my first choice for a new application.</p>

<p>As for the JS.geo event itself, I am intrigued by its small, focused nature. It doesn't seem to be as informal as an unconference but may be easier to digest than the typical geo event. It will also be great to catch up with the Front Range crowd.</p>

    <link href="http://blog.geomusings.com/2011/04/29/arkansas-evaluating-geospatial-cloud-infrastructures/"/>
    <updated>2011-04-29T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.geomusings.com/2011/04/29/arkansas-evaluating-geospatial-cloud-infrastructures</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.zekiah.com">My company</a> has recently begun working on a project for the Arkansas Geographic Information Office (AGIO) to evaluate options for potentially migrating the <a href="http://www.geostor.arkansas.gov/G6/Home.html">GeoStor</a> geospatial infrastructure to a cloud computing environment. If you are unfamiliar with GeoStor, it is the official geospatial platform for the State of Arkansas and is maintained by AGIO. I realize, as does AGIO, that "the cloud" has become a buzzword that has lost any meaningful context. So, for purposes of discussion, we'll go with the NIST draft definition available here: <a href="http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/drafts/800-145/Draft-SP-800-145_cloud-definition.pdf">http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/drafts/800-145/Draft-SP-800-145_cloud-definition.pdf</a>.</p>

<p>For this effort, we are open to considering any service model but we have strict guidance that the only deployment model of interest is the public cloud model.<!--more--></p>

<p>We are currently engaged in developing a detailed characterization of the current state of GeoStor (software, hardware, support, staffing), its user base and the products and services it provides. From there, we will derive the functional capabilities that are employed by GeoStor and would need to be supported in a new architecture.</p>

<p>At that point, we will distribute a survey so that interested vendors may assess the ability of their products to meet those requirements. We have been directed to "cast the net wide" so as not to miss out on potentially compelling solutions. After some discussion, we decided a post such as this may be a good way to kick off the process.</p>

<p><img alt="The floodgates are open" src="http://verizonvoyager.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/flood-gates-550x412.jpg" /></p>

<p>So, if you feel you have a product/service/solution that you would like considered and would like to receive this survey, please send the following information to me by e-mail (<a href="mailto:bill@zekiah.com?subject=GeoStor Survey">bill@zekiah.com</a>):</p>

<ul>
    <li>Your company name</li>

    <li>Name of the relevant point of contact within your company</li>

    <li>E-mail address of the point of contact</li>

    <li>Phone number of the point of contact</li>
</ul>


<p>We realize that we may be opening the floodgates with this but we also feel, given the volatile nature of this space, that more information is better than less. That said, here are a few guidelines:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Please do not attempt to contact me, my company or AGIO about this effort other than to send the information requested above. We are quite busy with characterization efforts and cannot take time away from that to answer questions. The nature of the GeoStor requirements will be evident from the survey.</li>
    <li>This post, the survey or any activity related to it should not be construed as a request for proposal or an intent to engage in a procurement or acquisition of any kind. This is strictly a market survey activity.</li>
    <li>My company is acting solely as a consultant and cannot represent AGIO in any official capacity. No communication from me or my company, including this post, should be considered a representation of the intent or positions of AGIO in any way.</li>
</ul>

    <updated>2011-04-28T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.geomusings.com/2011/04/28/wherecampdc-is-set</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I just learned from <a href="http://twitter.com/wonderchook">Kate Chapman</a> that the date for <a href="http://wherecampdc.org/">WhereCampDC</a> has been set. It will be Saturday, June 11th. If you are interested in attending, you can register through EventBrite <a href="http://wherecampdc.eventbrite.com/">here</a>. Move fast because it'll probably fill up quickly!</p>

<p>Despite all the of geospatial activity in this region, there has been a dearth of conference activity. The <a href="http://www.esri.com/events/feduc/index.html">Esri FedUC</a> has been the only game in town for years so WhereCampDC is a welcome addition to the scene. Also, the very structured conference environment around here could stand a little injection of "un" into its veins. :)</p>

<p>Oh yeah, there'll be lightning talks on the 10th, too!</p>

<p>See you there!</p>
