    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I mean <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wine">wine</a>, not <a href="http://www.winehq.org/">Wine</a>.</p>

<p>I've got to give kudos for innovative marketing on this one. I found this interesting announcement from gvSIG in my inbox this morning:</p>

<blockquote>
Enosat, in collaboration with the Association gvSIG, is going to carry  
out an online course on Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and  
Remote Sensing applied to vine-growing for the English-speaking  
community.

This new edition of the course is launched in English, hoping to  
repeat the success of the previous edition in Spanish.

The GIS software used for this course is free software (gvSIG Desktop).

This course covers the basic concepts of GIS and Remote Sensing.  
Furthermore, it enables students to apply these concepts to their  
professional area. This course is aimed at the wine sector, that is,  
technicians in charge of wineries, vine growers, etc.

Places on the course are limited and the admission is in order of  
registration. The syllabus and course details can be found at  
<a href="http://www.enosat.com/formation.php">http://www.enosat.com/formation.php</a>
For further information, please contact: <a href="mailto:course.enosat@gmail.com">course.enosat@gmail.com</a>
</blockquote>


<p>I really hope this takes off as I am already envisioning a host of implementation services built around this market. Now I've just got to translate my rates into bottles per hour. ;-)</p>

    <id>http://blog.geomusings.com/2009/11/12/gvSIG-1.9-Released</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Just ahead of the <a href="http://www.gvsig.gva.es/eng/inicio-gvsig/">gvSIG</a> <a href="http://jornadas.gvsig.org/home/view?set_language=en">conference</a> in Valencia, <a href="http://www.gvsig.gva.es/eng/gvsig-desktop/all-versions/download/gvsig-19/downloading-the-program/">version 1.9</a> has been released. gvSIG is an open-source desktop GIS developed in Java. The new features in 1.9 are summarized <a href="http://www.gvsig.gva.es/eng/gvsig-desktop/all-versions/download/gvsig-19/version-notes/new-features/">here</a>.</p>

<p>Some of the new features, including SLD import/export, are pretty interesting. gvSIG seems to be flourishing a bit under the wing of <a href="http://www.osgeo.org/gvsig">OSGEO</a>. It's a tool that I have gone back to periodically over the years, and I'll probably take a deeper dive this time given some of the new features. I suggest giving gvSIG a go if you haven't tried it.</p>

<p>UPDATE: The gvSIG download site seems to be having some serious bandwidth issues.</p>
