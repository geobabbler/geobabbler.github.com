    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After being involved with <a href="http://pub.obtusesoft.com">zigGIS</a> for a couple of years now, I'm excited that <a href="http://paolocorti.net">Paolo Corti</a> is going to be visiting the States next week and that Abe and I will finally get to meet him (and vice versa). The three of us will be meeting at the <a href="http://www.lolitabar.net">Lolita Bar</a> in New York City at 6pm on April 24th.</p>

<p>If you're in the area (or you want to make a special trip), we could use all the help we can get to give Paolo a warm welcome to the US. I hope to see you there. <a href="http://twitter.com/zigGIS">Tweet us</a> if you think you'll make it.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>Update: "The GIS Forum" mentioned here is no longer online.</strong></p>

<p>If you haven't seen Allan Laframboise's excellent presentation from the DevSummit on the <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/aGISGuy/geoweb-community-development-how-web-20-are-you">GeoWeb Community</a>, I highly encourage you to check it out. It includes some poll results with very surprising data about the use of social media (or lack thereof) by GIS developers.</p>

<p>One of the resources that he mentions near the end is <a href="http://www.thegisforum.com">the GIS Forum</a>, which has been covered by others. I wanted to take the opportunity to highlight, in the spirit of Allan's presentation, the growing list of GIS folks on Twitter that is being compiled on the GIS Forum. It can be found <a href="http://www.thegisforum.com/wikis/socialmedia/twitter-names.aspx">here</a>.</p>

<p>I personally find <a href="http://twitter.com">Twitter</a> to be an invaluable resource. I also find the GIS Forum to be a nice complement to it as a means to support more detailed discussions that may spin off from Twitter interaction. If you're just getting started on Twitter (or doing your homework that Allan assigned), I suggest checking out the list to build your community quickly.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Work has a funny way of intruding on blogging. I've been writing a LOT of proposals lately. The funny part is that so have a lot of others that I know. Federal, state, local...they seem to have gotten their budgets all at the same time. There are worse problems to have.</p>

<p>During this period (which I am calling my "Word Period") I have been watching as <a href="http://abegillespie.blogspot.com">Abe</a> and <a href="http://www.paolocorti.net">Paolo</a> get <a href="http://obtusesoft.com">zigGIS</a> out the door. I was able to confirm that I indeed introduced a bug a couple of versions back. I guess you can't win 'em all.</p>

<p>I have been keeping my sanity by slinging a little code here and there. I am hoping to finish up an experimental <a href="http://twitter.com">Twitter</a> client for <a href="http://www.esri.com/software/arcgis/explorer/index.html">ArcGIS Explorer</a>. Mainly, it's an exercise to get me familiar with the Twitter and <a href="http://twittervision.com/">Twittervision</a> APIs. Plus, it's been a while since I've done anything with AGX. The upcoming builds look exciting so I want to get comfortable with it again.</p>

<p>There's light at the end of tunnel on the proposal stuff so I'm hoping to get a little more technical again here in the next couple of weeks. Until then, I'll have to accept the fact that Word, Paint.Net, Acrobat and Twhirl (all work and no play) have pushed Visual Studio and anything GIS related off my recently used list.</p>
