    <id>http://blog.geomusings.com/2013/10/07/maryland-department-of-planning-bundles-property-data-with-qgis</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This past week, I got an e-mail from Jim Cannistra, Director of Data Planning Services and the <a href="http://www.mdp.state.md.us/home.shtml">Maryland Department of Planning</a> (MDP), alerting me to a new product available from MDP called <a href="http://www.mdp.state.md.us/OurProducts/PropertyMapProducts/FINDERProduct.shtml">FINDER Quantum</a>. This product bundles Maryland property data and related products with <a href="http://qgis.org">QGIS</a> software to provide users with a fully-functional, free-standing system for interacting with the data. It is designed to replace an older, custom software product, capitalizing on an industry-standard open-source system.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>From the MDP site, the bundled data includes:</p>

<blockquote cite="http://www.mdp.state.md.us/OurProducts/PropertyMapProducts/FINDERProduct.shtml">The product DVD includes the State's computerized property (tax) maps; the x,y linkages (point or polygon) to the Parcel, Computer Assisted Mass Appraisal (CAMA) and Sale datasets; Parcel, CAMA and Sale data, including Sale data via download from the Subscriber Website, from the Maryland State Department of Assessments and Taxation (SDAT); reference grids including a grid for the property (tax) maps, an ADC map book grid, a grid for the Maryland State Highway Administration (SHA) road, stream and feature maps and a grid for USGS 7.5' Topographical quad maps; and additional SHA files including a digital centerline roads file, data derived from SHA digital grid maps, an SHA major roads file and a county boundary file.<br/>
<br/>
Also included are land use/land cover data; congressional and legislative district boundary files; census geography and census demographic data; ZIP code boundary files; Priority Funding Area (PFA) designations; floodplain data, including DFIRM data for selected jurisdictions; protected lands boundaries; watershed data; generalized zoning designations; sewer service area boundaries; public water service area boundaries for selected jurisdictions; National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) Maryland coverage; residential Sales x,y point and summary files derived from SDAT Parcel and Sale data; large-scale, high resolution color digital-ortho imagery and a custom Quantum GIS project file (.qgs).</blockquote>


<p>The MDP site indicates there is a <a href="http://www.mdp.state.md.us/pdf/OurProducts/PropertyMapProducts/Finder/CstFnd.pdf">licensing fee</a> (PDF), which I assume is to cover the management of the data sets and the <a href="http://www.mdp.state.md.us/pdf/OurProducts/PropertyMapProducts/Finder/LicFnd.pdf">license agreement</a>, while acknowledging the GPL license of QGIS itself, seems to place the actual FINDER extension itself outide of any open-source license. (I am not a lawyer so I'll accept guidance on that interpretation.) That said, bundling QGIS with data that the statewide user community values and an application to help exploit it is a great way to get more users on board with QGIS.</p>

<p>To that end, users that choose to take advantage of FINDER Quantum will want to keep in mind that great <a href="http://www.esrgc.org/training/">QGIS-related resources</a> are available via <a href="http://www.salisbury.edu/geography/">Salisbury State University</a> and that training is also available from <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=14036437">Randal Hale</a> of <a href="http://www.northrivergeographic.com/introduction-to-quantum-gis">North River Geographics</a>. Once you have this powerful application installed, you can start to tap into a <a href="http://boundlessgeo.com/solutions/solutions-software/quantum-gis/">deep pool</a> of <a href="http://www.osgeo.org/search_profile">resources</a> to build your expertise.</p>

<p>So kudos to MDP for bundling their data with a powerful mapping, visualization, and analysis tool in QGIS. I hope that, in the near future, MDP considers making the FINDER application itself open-source but this is a great first step.</p>

    <updated>2013-09-20T09:57:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.geomusings.com/2013/09/20/come-sling-code-with-us</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It's been a pretty good week for us at <a href="http://www.zekiah.com">Zekiah</a>. We announced two new <a href="http://www.zekiah.com/index.php?q=press/2013/09/16/zekiah-technologies-inc-wins-marine-corps-logistics-support-services-mclogss-contra">contract</a> <a href="http://www.zekiah.com/index.php?q=press/2013/09/16/zekiah-technologies-inc-awarded-contract-mission-assurance-division">wins</a> and I'm pleased to say that we're not done yet. After final paperwork is done, we should be able to announce a couple more. These are the things that make small-business ownership worthwhile: doing good work, building relationships with our customers and then leveraging our track record to be able to work with new customers. Project execution and business development help us build the foundation necessary to be a good place for our employees to work and we try hard every day to make sure that we are such a place.</p>

<p>The second contract win we announced this week, with the US Navy's Mission Assurance Division in Dahlgren, Virginia, is particularly fulfilling for us because we have worked side-by-side with that organization since the late 1990's, doing challenging work in the areas of infrastructure protection and situational awareness during that time. We have literally grown and evolved alongside them over that time.</p>

<p>I typically try not to mix my blog with the daily operational aspects of my work at Zekiah. Usually, my work comes through in abstracted form in various posts, although many posts actually reflect my own personal experimentation and side projects. I'm stepping outside of that practice today to say that our latest contract win has given us <a href="http://www.zekiah.com/index.php?q=careers/openings/gis-software-developer-ii">an opening for a software developer</a> to come work with us at the Mission Assurance Division.</p>

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://blog.geomusings.com/images/posts/desk.jpg" /><div style="text-align: center;font-size: 14px;">Can you bring this workstation to life?</div></div>


<br />




<!--more-->


<p>This is an immediate opening and you would be performing .Net development with the full range of Microsoft and Esri technologies. The work has been challenging and is mission-essential for not only our customer but their sponsors as well. The work would require you to be on-site full time but you would be working with one of the most talented teams of developers, both government and contractor, with which I have ever been associated. This is a group from which I have learned a great deal and still do. This specific position is not for someone who is particularly senior but it is also not entry-level either. It's a great opportunity to grow a career that's underway and picking up steam.</p>

<p>You can get some details by checking out the <a href="http://www.zekiah.com/index.php?q=careers/openings/gis-software-developer-ii">offical job posting</a>, where you can also apply online. Most of that language is pulled directly from the description in the contract. If you want to get an idea of what the day-to-day work looks like, <a href="http://blog.geomusings.com/about/">you can always contact me directly</a>. I will draw your attention to one requirement, however: "Active security clearance or the ability to obtain a security clearance." What that means is that we can't entertain staffing via offshoring, nor can we consider applicants who do not hold US citizenship. I bring that up only because everyone's time is valuable and I'd hate for you to waste your time applying if we can't consider you.</p>

<p>So, if you're looking for the next challenge in your career and want to work with a great team, please send us your vitals. Some of the best and most meaningful work I've done in my career was done supporting this customer.</p>

    <link href="http://blog.geomusings.com/2013/09/10/random-geospatial-grab-bag/"/>
    <updated>2013-09-10T10:16:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.geomusings.com/2013/09/10/random-geospatial-grab-bag</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It's been a while since I've posted as the usual wind-down of summer and wind-up of the school year has had me otherwise engaged. What follows are few developments over the past few months that have floated through the transom of my geo-awareness.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://daylightdonutsstier.com/assets/images/slideshow/CakeDonuts.jpg" height="50%" width="50%"/></p>

<p><a href="http://geojson.io/">geojson.io</a> - Remember all of the attention given to the ability to render GitHub-hosted GeoJSON files as maps? Well, <a href="http://twitter.com/tmcw">Tom MacWright</a> of <a href="http://mapbox.com">MapBox</a> has, in fairly rapid fashion, given us this tool to edit GeoJSON in the browser and publish to either a GitHub repo or a gist. It's an easy-to-use tool with an interface consistent with other MapBox tools. It's definitely worth checking out and adds an important piece of workflow to the GeoJSON-on-GitHub concept.</p>

<!--more-->


<p><a href="http://gitspatial.com/">GitSpatial</a> - Continuing with the theme of being more productive with GeoJSON on GitHub, <a href="http://twitter.com/JCSanford">Jason Sanford</a> has developed GitSpatial to wrap a spatial API around your hosted GeoJSON. It actually works using a 'sync' approach so it pulls the GeoJSON into its own infrastructure and watchs the data on GitHub for changes. Jason has also updated his <a href="http://geojason.info/leaflet-vector-layers/">Leaflet Vector Layers</a> project to support GitSpatial. This project is in its early stages and Jason has been very open to feedback. I encourage you to check it out and help him make it better.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gaia-gis.it/fossil/virtualpg/index">VirtualPG</a> - This extension to SQLite/SpatiaLite was released in August and it is intended to facilitate data exchange between those platforms and PostgreSQL/PostGIS. I have yet to kick the tires on it but I plan to soon.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.dhs.gov/infrastructure-information-partnerships#2">HSIP 2013</a> - For the first time in quite a while, I attended a <a href="https://www.hifldwg.org/">HIFLD</a> meeting. The theme of the meeting was HSIP Feedback, to which about one HIFLD per year is dedicated. While HSIP has never been perfect, it has managed to evolve to provide value across numerous communities. The meeting featured a parade of users articulating the essential nature of HSIP to their missions. With HSIP 2013, the distribution expands to 6 DVDs. In my opinion, this distribution method is one of its biggest, and most solvable, problems. With a plethora of <a href="http://www.weogeo.com">technologies</a> to choose from, streamlining and tailoring the delivery of HSIP to its users should be low-hanging fruit for HSIP's custodians.</p>

<p>As for me, I've been spending my days writing interfaces for custom message formats to synchronize locations with video frames. It's much lower-level development than I've done in a while but it's been very fun. I've also been making some updates to my <a href="https://github.com/geobabbler/AGSOpenFormats">GeoJSON extension for ArcGIS Server</a> but I'll post about that in more detail soon.</p>

    <link href="http://blog.geomusings.com/2013/08/12/why-do-i-blog/"/>
    <updated>2013-08-12T12:00:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.geomusings.com/2013/08/12/why-do-i-blog</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>TL;DR:</h2>

<p>In which, as a result of a <a href="http://blog.entchev.com/2013/08/08/gis-blogging-in-decline.aspx">post by Atanas Entchev</a>, I postulate on why I continue to do this blog thing. This is a departure from my typical subject matter and you can be forgiven for not reading any further.</p>

<hr />

<p>My friend <a href="http://twitter.com/atanas">Atanas Entchev's</a> <a href="http://blog.entchev.com/2013/08/08/gis-blogging-in-decline.aspx">latest post</a> on a possible decline in GIS blogging got me looking at my own output. After and initial surge, I have held steady at 40 to 45 posts per year. The discussion around Atanas' post, both in his blog comments and on his <a href="https://plus.google.com/110319601981109631300/posts/A3twyjrs8yL">Google+ stream</a>, got me thinking about why I continue to do this. So, at the risk of being accused of engaging in philosophical navel-gazing, here it goes.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://blog.geomusings.com/images/posts/posts.png" /></p>

<p>This blog was not my first attempt at blogging. I originally had an <a href="http://www.esri.com">ESRI</a>-development focused blog on Blogger in about 2004. I think I made four or five posts, let it languish for a bit, and then killed it off. The main reason for that is that I wasn't really sure what I was trying to accomplish with a blog. I never even backed it up so whatever was there is lost to the ages.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>Fast-forward to 2006 when I was at a stage in my career where I was working at a fairly cloistered customer site, building a human resources management system...in VB.NET no less. It was the first time since the beginning of my career that I was away from the GIS industry and I wasn't interested in letting my skills soften. Up until that point, I had been primarily an ESRI developer but I was now using evenings at home to do experimental stuff to keep current. My company machine had ArcMap on it but I wasn't going to swing an SDE license at home so I started looking at <a href="http://www.postgis.org">PostGIS</a>. That's when I ran across <a href="https://code.google.com/p/ziggis/">zigGIS</a> and used it to extend out of my ESRI comfort zone into the world of open-source GIS.</p>

<p>All of that lead me to start blogging. Initially, I was doing web searches to find out how to do things I was trying to with ArcObjects and PostGIS. I would occasionally find a post that provided a good overview of a coding techniques or an in-depth discussion of how a piece of software behaved, but they were few and far between. That's when I finally had a concept for a blog: to write the kind of blog that I was looking for and would want to read. So my early posts featured a lot of code snippets and such (this was in the pre- <a href="https://gist.github.com/">Gist</a> days when sites like <a href="http://sourceforge.net/">SourceForge</a>, <a href="https://code.google.com/">Google Code</a> and <a href="https://www.codeplex.com/">CodePlex</a> were overkill for snippets). It also generally tracked my growing personal explorations with open-source tools.</p>

<p>So that's how I got into blogging but the title of this post is really looking for the reasons why I keep doing it. I'll summarize:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>To give back - Over the years, the snippets have gotten more sporadic but I still try to post some outputs of my work from time to time. I can't really devote the time to jump into an open-source project with both feet so my hope is that my blog can be an avenue to contribute back some of the knowledge I derive from my work.</p></li>
<li><p>To engage - I am a consultant after all. I am able to continue to ply my trade by being known and my blog is one component of building the track record of my work. Due to vagaries of Federal contracts, much of my work remains behind firewalls so my blog is a way to demonstrate some of what I can do outside the standard Federal procurement process. I would also be remiss if I didn't acknowledge that my blog has been an avenue by which I have met a number of people that I now consider friends. For fear of leaving someone out, I won't enumerate them here but the act of writing my blog, and reading others, has helped me connect with a lot of people I am glad to know.</p></li>
<li><p>To act as my own resource - I have often gone back to mine old posts to find a technique I implemented in the past and bring it forward to my current work. So, while my blog is out there for the public to see, it has become something of my own personal archive as well. It remains to be seen whether <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a> and Gist will put a dent in that use case.</p></li>
<li><p>To tidy up my own mind - It actually takes a lot of work to prepare a post, or at least it does for me. Oftentimes, I have a lot of "bit and pieces" floating around in my head and on various notepads and such. One of the attributes of working at multiple locations is that various pieces of related information can become scattered across separate e-mail systems, content management systems, notepads, post-its and the like. I can't always have my smartphone with me or access my GMail, so some fragmentation can set in. Taking the time to write a post is an excellent way for me to pull together all of those disparate bits, organize them into a cohesive approach, and document that approach for others and for me (see item 3).</p></li>
<li><p>I am a writer - I used to write a lot of fiction and poetry. One day I may do so again. Until then, my blog scratches the itch for stringing some words together into something coherent.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>I remain committed to the idea of writing the kind of blog that I would want to read and I have tried to be consistent about that over the years. I am actually quite humbled that it seems to have found an audience, that anyone other than me reads it, and that others find value in it.</p>

<p>I can completely understand <a href="http://www.jonathancrowe.net/">Jonathan Crowe's</a> decision to end his long-running, and excellent, blog <a href="http://www.maproomblog.com/2011/06/the_end.php">The Map Room</a>. Sometimes things just run their course. This much I can say: I won't be ending mine in the near future. Late last year, I took the step of migrating my blog from Wordpress.com to a Jekyll/Octopress site hosted on GitHub pages. Extracting six years of content from Wordpress was no small task (thanks for the help, <a href="http://twitter.com/cageyjames">James</a>) so I did a gut check before moving forward. I decided that taking that step was a commitment to keep the blog going for the foreseeable future.</p>

<p>So back to Atanas' post: I do think GIS blogging, in the form it took when I started, is in decline. There were a lot of personal GIS blogs in 2006, many of which have fallen by the wayside. That's probably true of blogs in general as social media platforms have eaten away at them. I don't know that it's a loss; I don't know that it's important at all. Human communication evolves over time. We just happen to be in a period where that process seems to be moving rapidly.</p>

<p>That said, some good individual blogs have popped up but I think blogging in general is becoming more polished and corporate. I think some of the better original content these days comes from multiple authors contributing to organizational blogs. In the geospatial industry, the <a href="http://www.mapbox.com/blog/">MapBox blog</a> stands out as this type of blog. Yes, the blog forwards the ends of MapBox but its content is genuinely useful to those trying to put MapBox to use. The same can be said of some of <a href="http://blogs.esri.com/esri/arcgis/">Esri's blogs</a>, the content of which has shown marked improvement over the last 24 months or so.</p>

<p>Blogs can also help small companies establish their identity. At <a href="http://www.zekiah.com">my company</a>, we started a <a href="http://www.zekiah.com/index.php?q=blog">blog</a> a while back as a means to add fresh insights into our capabilities beyond the standard representation that most company web sites provide. Blogs are a nice long-form enhancement for organizations and I think they are safer because they minimize the risk misinterpretation that comes with a 140-character limit.</p>

<p>So that's it. This is about as "meta" as I ever want to get on my blog. I don't think I'll do anything like this again because it smacks of philosophical navel-gazing. (I am usually my own harshest critic in that area.)  Thank you, as always, for stopping by.</p>

    <link href="http://blog.geomusings.com/2013/07/28/devops-for-geospatial-data/"/>
    <updated>2013-07-28T10:54:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.geomusings.com/2013/07/28/devops-for-geospatial-data</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There has been a bit of buzz the past couple of weeks over the <a href="https://github.com/blog/1541-geojson-rendering-improvements">ability of GitHub to render GeoJSON and TopoJSON files</a> automatically using  and embedded <a href="http://leafletjs.com/">Leaflet</a> map and <a href="http://www.mapbox.com/">MapBox</a> technology. This buzz is quite justified as it presents an easy way to simply publish and visualize vector data sets. In the weeks since the initial announcement, the community has begun exploring the limits of GitHub's capability. Probably the two biggest limiting factors are individual file size limits and API rate limits. Some, including myself, are exploring strategies for maximizing the ability to store, disseminate, and visualize data within these confines. For the near term, <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> will probably not be the place to store terabytes of data or act as the CDN for a high-volume mapping application. That is perfectly fine and there is still a great deal of value to be found within GitHub's current generous constraints.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://blog.geomusings.com/images/posts/geodata-git.png" /></p>

<p>One aspect of GitHub (really, its underlying <a href="http://git-scm.com/">git</a> engine) that is of great interest to me is the ability to perform version control and configuration management on data itself. With GitHub, that currently takes the form of text-based formats such as JSON but it's a start. In my experience supporting various customers over the years, configuration management of data has been a common gap in information operations. The most common, and inadequate, approach to this problem has been through the use of metadata. Almost two decades of viewing out-of-date, incomplete, and inaccurate metadata has given the lie to this approach. Metadata represents a separate maintenance workflow for which many organizations simply do not dedicate resources. Data-set-level metadata is also inadequate for volatile data sets in which individual records are updated frequently.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>I have worked with many organizations that had excellent DevOps processes for managing and deploying application code that simply had no corresponding processes for the data that the code was utilizing. We are long past time for addressing the importance of configuration management for data itself.</p>

<p>That is not to say there have not been approaches to addressing this issue. Since version 8.0, <a href="http://www.esri.com">Esri</a> has had a means of <a href="http://www.esri.com/software/arcgis/geodatabase/multi-user-functionality">versioning enterprise geodatabases</a> that are stored in an RDBMS. This approach does have the ability to track feature-level changes and manages their inclusion in the master version of the data set. Quite frankly, I've never loved the Esri approach to versioning. I think it gives too much responsibility to middleware when it should be the database's sole responsibility to keep itself intact. Also, I have always felt the workflow is a bit too proscribed and takes too much business process decision ability from the data owner. That said, it has been the only real game in town for a long time so I have implemented it many times.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/">OpenStreetMap</a> (OSM) has also been a success story for tracking feature-level version history. Its approach has successfully managed millions of edits to a worldwide database so its utility is certainly proven. Organizations that need to maintain their own data behind their firewalls cannot really make use of OSM itself but the OSM approach is solid.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.zekiah.com">At my own company</a>, we have been working with customers to implement <a href="http://blog.geomusings.com/2012/03/27/configuration-management-for-geospatial-data-models/">configuration management of data models</a> (logical and physical) but we are not really addressing CM of the data managed by those models. Even so, working at the model/schema level has still helped our customers improve their data management workflows by being able to identify versions of data models supported by deployed applications and helping to migrate between versions as needed.</p>

<p>The recent move by GitHub to support visualization of spatial data files actually introduces no new capability in terms of configuration management of data files. Users have always had the ability to store and manage JSON, text, XML and other formats in GitHub and git. My hope is that the visualization capability, and the inevitable exploration it will generate, will shine more light on the issue of data configuration management. In my opinion, this is the most powerful aspect the platform brings.</p>

<p>I'm also encouraged by <a href="http://opengeo.org/">OpenGeo's</a> <a href="https://github.com/opengeo/GeoGit">GeoGit</a> initiative. I have not personally experimented with it yet so I will not speculate on the specifics of its implementation, but I am happy to see OpenGeo recognizing the need for a more open approach to feature-level version control. Since, however, it will be open-source, my hope is that proprietary GIS vendors, or their supporting integrators, will eventually support it as well.</p>

<p>Ultimately, I am happy to see both GitHub and OpenGeo addressing this issue. Although their approaches are different, they offer, in addition to the Esri approach, choices for organizations in terms of workflow. Many data managers, whether for legal, strategic, or other reasons, recognize the importance of maintaining version history of geospatial data records. It is important for everything from parcel mapping to critical infrastructure protection and many other use cases. Historically, there have been very few tools available to address this problem effectively but I am hoping that is starting to change.</p>
