    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://twitter.com/bitnerd">David Bitner</a> sent out a reminder that Early Bird reagistration for the <a href="http://foss4g-na.org/">FOSS4G North America</a> conference closes on 1 April 2013. After that, the price goes up by $50 US. You can register <a href="http://foss4gna.eventbrite.com/">online at EventBrite</a>.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"> <img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/30/20060131_earthworm_hits_dirt.jpg" width="400" height="266"/></p>

<p>The <a href="http://foss4g-na.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/PreliminaryProgram.pdf">preliminary program</a> (PDF) for this year's event looks exceptional, building upon and potentially exceeding the outstanding quality of FOSS4G-NA 2012. I'll be sorry to miss the conference this year but will be looking forward to its social media exhaust.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Just a quick note to tidy up some loose ends related to recent posts...</p>

<p>First, regarding the post "<a href="http://blog.geomusings.com/2013/03/17/a-lazyweb-compendium-of-python-resources-for-beginners/">A #LazyWeb Compendium of Python Resources for Beginners</a>," the University of South Florida PyBulls Python interest group, as promised, compiled a list of Python resources and posted it <a href="https://github.com/PyBulls/learning-resources">on their GitHub page</a>. Thanks to them for their quick response.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"> <img src="http://img.ehowcdn.com/article-new/ehow/images/a06/kv/li/proper-cutting-down-tree-chainsaw-800x800.jpg" /></p>

<p>Second, following up on the post "<a href="http://blog.geomusings.com/2013/03/20/the-best-thing-i-saw-at-tugis-2013/">The Best Thing I Saw at TUGIS 2013</a>," the data and workbooks for Dr. Arthur Lembo's introduction to open-source GIS have been made available. The data <a href="https://github.com/esrgc/qgistraining">can be found on GitHub</a> and the workbooks can be found on the <a href="http://www.esrgc.org/training/">Eastern Shore Regional GIS Cooperative web site</a>. Many thanks for contributing these resources.</p>

<p>These items are embedded in the comments for their respective posts but I thought it would be useful to call them out more prominently.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I spent the day yesterday at <a href="http://www.towson.edu/">Towson University</a> attending the <a href="http://www.towson.edu/tugis/">TUGIS 2013</a> conference. The new one-day format was a firehose that showcased the diversity of geospatial work occurring across the State of Maryland. The keynote by <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=44978536">Learon Dalby</a> was well-received and the content of the conference was generally substantive. While the day was a sprint, there was one workshop that really caught my attention more so than I would have thought from its title.</p>

<p>The photo below shows 40 participants of an "Introduction to Free and Open Source GIS Software" workshop getting hands-on experience with <a href="http://www.qgis.org">QGIS</a> and <a href="http://www.postgis.org">PostGIS</a> by working through prepared but realistic scenarios. These scenarios included doing multi-user editing and performing spatial analysis to assess the effects of a potential toxic release over a small town.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"> <img src="http://blog.geomusings.com/images/posts/tugis2013_workshop.jpg" /></p>

<p>The workshop was put together by <a href="http://faculty.salisbury.edu/~ajlembo/">Dr. Arthur Lembo</a> of <a href="http://www.salisbury.edu/">Salisbury University</a> and conducted by him and a team of his students, who not only led portions of the workshop but were also stationed around the room to provide guidance to participants. The scenarios were prepared in printed workbooks that the participants were free to take with them, along with information about how to download the tools. All-in-all, I thought the workshop was very well-designed and presented a thorough overview of the capabilities of these two tools.</p>

<p>To be sure, the workshop was not all unicorns and rainbows. There were typical glitches such as file system and database permission issues that required on-the-fly adjustments, which Dr. Lembo and his students handled well. Some participants were clearly stumped at points while others were making good headway with the examples.</p>

<p>Many of the participants probably remain committed <a href="http://www.esri.com">ArcGIS</a> users after the workshop while others may very well dig in and more thoroughly explore QGIS and PostGIS, but that's really beside the point. Regardless of what the individual participants decide to do with the information from the workshop, all left with hands-on exposure to the tools that was presented in a manner that was free of hyperbole, FUD, or market-speak. They now have more first-hand information with which to make their own educated decisions as to how they want to proceed with their geospatial technology choices; and that, in my opinion, may have been the most valuable outcome of the workshop.</p>

    <id>http://blog.geomusings.com/2013/03/18/off-to-tugis</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Tomorrow, I'll be heading up to the <a href="http://www.towson.edu/tugis/">Towson University GIS (TUGIS) conference</a> with 500 or so of my closest Maryland geo-friends. It has been restructured into a one-day event and the program seems to be very content-rich as a result. I am particularly happy to see more open-source content this year. There's an intro session featuring <a href="http://www.postgresql.org">PostgreSQL</a>, <a href="http://www.postgis.org">PostGIS</a>, <a href="http://qgis.org">QGIS</a>, and <a href="http://geoserver.org">GeoServer</a> presented by <a href="http://www.salisbury.edu/">Salisbury State University</a>. Salisbury was once known as a bastion of <a href="http://www.manifold.net/">Manifold</a> so they've got a long history of thinking outside the Arc. Additionally, there is a session (by Towson University) discussing the use of <a href="http://www.gdal.org">GDAL</a>, <a href="http://www.gdal.org/ogr/">OGR</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/sgillies/shapely">Shapely</a> in the development of a spatial service.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"> <img src="http://blog.geomusings.com/images/mdflag.png" alt="Brian Timoney's favorite state flag" title="Brian Timoney's favorite state flag" /></p>

<p>One thing I like about regional GIS conferences like this is that they tend to focus more on solutions to real-world problems instead of the latest technological bells and whistles. I spend so much of my time with my head in Federal requirements that it's nice do a reset and get different perspectives on how geospatial technologies are used. I am particularly interested to hear the keynote from <a href="http://twitter.com/learondalby">Learon Dalby</a> of <a href="http://www.sanborn.com/">Sanborn</a> and formerly of the <a href="http://www.gis.state.ar.us/">Arkansas GIO office</a>. I had the pleasure of working with Learon and the AGIO team on a project a couple of years ago and am impressed with what they accomplished.</p>

<p>I appreciate the new format of TUGIS as a one-day event is much easier to fit into the schedule. I'm looking forward to it.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A friend who is in the midst of a career change and moving into the GIS world asked me for some pointers to resources for getting started with Python. I threw the question out to Twitter (with a similar variation also posted to Google+):</p>

<p>{% tweet http://twitter.com/billdollins/status/313263420923338753 %}</p>

<p>I got a couple of requests to summarize any information I received, which seemed reasonable. I got quite a few responses and here are some links:</p>

<a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/cs101">Udacity</a></p>

<p>I can't claim to have checked out all of them, but I consider the recommendations to have come from trusted sources. So, if you're <a href="http://blog.geomusings.com/2013/01/30/yes-you-need-to-code/">looking to expand your GIS expertise by adding some Python knowledge</a>, these may be a good place to start. Not all of them are free-of-charge since that wasn't one of my friend's requirements.</p>

<p>Additionally, Dan Dye informs me that the PyBulls Python interest group at the University of South Florida will take up this question and post a document with a list of resources on GitHub. Be sure to keep an eye on <a href="https://github.com/pybulls/">https://github.com/pybulls/</a> . Thank you!</p>
