    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>What does one do when presented with more snow days than expected? My friends in Colorado would probably do something outrageous like skiing, but I found it to be a great opportunity to catch up on some of my recreational coding. Specifically, I wanted to revisit the <a href="http://blog.geomusings.com/2013/12/11/building-a-simple-geodata-service-with-node-and-amazon-rds/">Node/PostGIS work I blogged about earlier</a>.</p>

<p>As fun as that project was, it was fairly limited in scope and I wanted to spread my wings a little more with Node. So I decided to build a more general-purpose wrapper around <a href="http://postgis.net">PostGIS</a>. Lately, I've become a bit obsessed with the idea that PostGIS may be the only GIS tool you really need in terms of data storage, management, and analytics. That's probably a topic for another post but exploring that concept was a perfect premise for my continued explorations with Node.</p>

<p>I have been circling back to Node over the past few months to continue building my comfort level with it. I tend to eschew frameworks when i have learning something new because I want to get comfortable with the core before I start layering on abstraction. That was my approach with <a href="http://blog.geomusings.com/2013/04/25/simple-tile-viewer/">the tile viewer tool I built a while back</a>. For the recent post centered on Amazon RDS, I added Express into the mix, which has been a big help.</p>

<p>This time around, I wanted to dig a little deeper with the <a href="https://github.com/brianc/node-postgres">node-postgres</a> module and also make the application more modular. I wanted to build around a few core principles:</p>

<ol>
<li>Keep it RESTful (or as close to it as I could)</li>
<li>GeoJSON in/GeoJSON out (so....vector only for now)</li>
<li>Let PostGIS do the heavy lifting</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Getting Started</strong></p>

<p>This time around, I elected to use my local PostgreSQL/PostGIS instance rather than Amazon RDS. This was mainly so I could keep my development isolated on one machine. I already had the basic infrastructure in place from my last time around, so I was able to quickly dive into the meat of things. I decided to scope my initial effort at the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>Return the contents of an entire table as GeoJSON, with the ability to choose between features (geometries and attributes) in a GeoJSON feature collection or just geometries in a GeoJSON geometry collection. This should support any table in the database.</li>
<li>Return those records in a table that intersect a geometry passed in as a parameter. The input geometry would be in GeoJSON format.</li>
<li>Return a JSON representation of a table's schema.</li>
<li>Return a list of tables from the server. This is necessary in order to support the ability to query any available table.</li>
<li>Implement some simple, but application-specific logic to demonstrate extensibility.</li>
</ol>


<p>With these goals in mind, I decided to first tackle the issue of extensibility. I wanted to make it as painless as possible and <a href="http://timstermatic.github.io/blog/2013/08/17/a-simple-mvc-framework-with-node-and-express/">the strategy described in this post</a> seemed to fit the bill. I just had to add the following code block to my server.js (straight from the post):</p>

<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'><figcaption><span>snippet1.js </span></figcaption>
 <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>

</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="nx">p</span><span class="o">&gt;</span>  <span class="p">}</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">});</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div></p>

<p>This will load any .js file in the controllers directory into the application. If they are written to the pattern expected by Express, new resource paths are exposed to the application. The post above describes a simple MVC implementation. Astute readers will note that my take is all "C" without "M" or "V." I plan to refactor that later but it it was easier for me to keep track of things on this pass with code in one place.</p>

<p><strong>Getting Data</strong></p>

<p>With modularity out of the way, it was time work on the basic structure for getting data from the database. In <a href="https://github.com/geobabbler/node-gis-server/blob/master/controllers/core.js">core.js</a>, I defined a route with a URL template like '/vector/:schema/:table/:geom'. This would translate into something like http://localhost/vector/public/parcels/features, which would fetch a GeoJSON feature collection containing the contents of the parcels table. To do that, I need to know the name of the spatial column in the table, which the following helps me retrieve:</p>

<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'><figcaption><span>snippet2.js </span></figcaption>
 <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='js'><span class='line'><span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">meta</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">client</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">query</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;select * from geometry_columns where f_table_name = &#39;&quot;</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="nx">tablename</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="s2">&quot;&#39; and f_table_schema = &#39;&quot;</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="nx">schemaname</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="s2">&quot;&#39;;&quot;</span><span class="p">);</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div></p>

<p>The next code block shows how I capture the name of the spatial column and structure the main query, depending on the choice of features or geometry:</p>

<p>As can be seen above, the query will transform the output geometry to WGS84 and convert it to GeoJSON for me. So I'm sticking my third principle by leaning on PostGIS functions here. I plan to stick to GeoJSON's default spatial reference of WGS84 for now. To roll up the query results into the appropriate GeoJSON object and return it, I handled the 'row' and 'end' events.</p>

<p>So that's basic data retrieval. How about that spatial intersect?</p>

<p><strong>A Simple Spatial Query</strong></p>

<p>One thing I failed to mention in the above section, is that all of that is exposed through an HTTP GET request. For this next function, I'm going to use a POST. I went back and forth on that but came down on the side of POST due to the potential for a user to send a very verbose input shape. The function is designed to accept JSON as the body of the request, which would be done in curl like this:</p>

<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'><figcaption><span>snippet6.bat </span></figcaption>
 <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bat'><span class='line'>curl -X POST -d <span class="s2">&quot;{ \&quot;</span>type\<span class="s2">&quot;: \&quot;</span>Point\<span class="s2">&quot;, \&quot;</span>coordinates\<span class="s2">&quot;: [-98.35, 39.7] }&quot;</span> -H <span class="s2">&quot;Content-Type: application/json&quot;</span> http:<span class="n">//localhost:3000/vector/public/states_gen/features/intersect</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div></p>

<p>The above action returns the state of Kansas (I knew you were wondering). To make this happen, there are only three things that are different. First, the URL is defined a POST and, second, the code needs to capture the input shape. The first few lines are:</p>

<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'><figcaption><span>snippet7.js </span></figcaption>

</span><span class='line'>    <span class="c1">//console.log(JSON.stringify(req.body));</span>

</span><span class='line'><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="nx">p</span><span class="o">&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div></p>

<p>I stringify the JSON since I have to insert it into my SQL. This brings me to the third difference here, the query. This time, I am using ST_INTERSECTS to filter down the response. So, depending on the choice of features or geometry, the query will be similar to:</p>

<p><strong>"select st_asgeojson(st_transform(" + spatialcol + ",4326)) as geojson, * from " + fullname + " where ST_INTERSECTS(" + spatialcol + ", ST_SetSRID(ST_GeomFromGeoJSON('" + queryshape + "'),4326));"</strong></p>

<p>The rest of the process is similar to the basic query above. With a well-exercised data access pattern in place, querying table schema and layer lists become trivial. Since GeoJSON doesn't cover these topics, I had to roll my own. I won't detail the output but the queries are below.</p>

<p>So this gives me everything I need for an all-purpose interface into PostGIS from Node. I could spend the rest of the year similarly wrapping the hundreds of spatial functions in PostGIS but the real power of extensibility is the ability to tailor an application for one's own needs, based upon one's detailed understanding of their own data and logic.</p>

<p><strong>Adding Some Customization</strong></p>

<p>To do this, I fell back to the data for <a href="http://leonardtown.somd.com">Leonardtown, Maryland</a> that have used in a <a href="http://blog.geomusings.com/2013/06/18/geojson-on-github-now-what/">couple</a> of previous <a href="http://blog.geomusings.com/2011/10/13/cartodb-leaflet-easy/">posts</a>. I am simply going to expose the ability to query residential or commercial buildings from the data set. For this, all of the prep work is done at the top of the function by simply preparing a WHERE clause.</p>

<p>The primary difference here are that I am using a GET with a query string since I'm not concerned with data size and that I'm building a WHERE clause on a specific column name. What's not shown is that, farther down, I don't need to query the name of the spatial column so I can cut out that step. I can do this because I understand my own data so I can be more succinct that if I were writing a more generic function. Using this approach I can also write more complex custom logic in my database, call it from Node, and send the response. In other words, standard web application behavior.</p>

<p>In order to expose this application-specific logic, I just needed expose it in a separate leonardtown.js file and drop it into the 'controllers' directory.</p>

<p><strong>Wrapping Up</strong></p>

<p>This post was bit longer than usual but there was lot of ground to cover. I feel like I'm getting more comfortable with the Node ecosystem though I'm still a bit wobbly. My next step is probably to dive a little deeper into the MVC side of things with something like <a href="http://sailsjs.org">Sails</a>. Having a familiar face like PostGIS on the back end is helping me as I figure out how to perform more meaningful tasks with Node and its related tools.</p>

    <updated>2014-02-13T17:19:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.geomusings.com/2014/02/13/initial-thoughts-on-the-dc-devsummit</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This week, I attended the first-ever <a href="http://www.esri.com">Esri</a> <a href="http://www.esri.com/events/devsummit-dc">DC DevSummit</a> which followed the <a href="http://www.esri.com/events/federal">Federal GIS Conference</a> (please switch it back to "FedUC"). This event, intended and a smaller, Federally-focused, companion to the annual Palm Springs DevSummit, came together quickly but was very well-attended with about 300 attendees.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"> <img src="http://blog.geomusings.com/images/posts/devsummit.jpg" /></p>

<p>It was interesting to note that the most well-attended sessions of the day had to do with Javascript (every Javascript session had over 100 participants). As more and more organizations update their IT infrastructures, the acceleration away from plug-ins seems to be picking up pace. The most common refrain amongst attendees in that regard is that continued standardization on IE8 remains the biggest impediment to sunsetting things like Flex and Silverlight, but the logjam seems to be starting to break loose.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>Despite the photo I posted, <a href="http://twitter.com/ajturner">Andrew Turner's</a> open-source session was fairly well-attended. It was good to see tools like <a href="https://github.com/Esri/koop">Koop</a> in action. It is clear that there is real effort going on within Esri to produce open-source tools and that the people working on them are genuinely committed to them. That said, it is obviously still early days and such efforts are clearly swimming upstream against the preponderance of corporate culture. This is an effort that will best be judged over the long haul.</p>

<p>I also have to give a shout out to <a href="http://twitter.com/agup">Andy Gup</a>, whom I finally met at this conference. By chance, I sat through three of his sessions. He is one of the best technical presenters I have ever seen and Esri should require junior staff to sit through his sessions to see how it should be done.</p>

<p>I found the DevSummit generally worthwhile and I was impressed with how well it came together given the short timeframe. Since I was encouraged to blog suggestions, here are a few:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Make a DevSummit a permanent fixture as a follow-on to the Federal User Conference each year. The format of this year's Federal conference can be tweaked but stay mainly focused on user-centric use cases and some intro-level discussions of technologies. A DevSummit would mark a shift in to much more technical content with advanced discussions of APIs, security, techniques and best practices.</p></li>
<li><p>Pull out the stops. As I indicated in item 1, ramp up the technical content, in comparison to that of the Federal conference, significantly. This year's event started down that path. I would keep the technical content of the Federal conference on the bunny slopes and shift to the black diamonds for the DevSummit.</p></li>
<li><p>Expand to two days. It was a quick day and there were definitely sessions I would have liked to have gotten to. Additionally, it would be good to see some user content, maybe some lightning talks on the evening between the days. One of the biggest challenges working in the Federal space is the compartmentalization between and within agencies. With the DevSummit drawing interested people to one location, it would be good to get more opportunities to interact with other developers and exchange information.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.gsa.gov/portal/category/102371?utm_source=OCM&amp;utm_medium=print-radio&amp;utm_term=HP_13_SpecialTopics_fedramp&amp;utm_campaign=shortcuts">FedRAMP</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Information_Security_Management_Act_of_2002">FISMA</a> were non-existent this year. Jim Barry explained to me that these were areas where content simply wasn't ready to go in the short time given to prepare for the DevSummit. That's fair, and I certainly respect the decision to not provide content that could not be done well. These are, however, core issues for anyone doing development for the Federal Government. Next year's DC DevSummit really needs to have content for developers attempting to deploy to FedRAMP and achieve FISMA compliance with Esri tools.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>Those my quick hits. I'll probably have more after I have time to digest what I saw and dig out from the backlog resulting from two days out of the office. Kudos to <a href="http://twitter.com/jimbarry">Jim Barry</a> for his work pulling the DC DevSummit together.</p>

One of the great things about working at a place like Zekiah, however, is the opportunity to work with smart people and see what they are doing. At times, my colleagues will share components of their work on the company blog. We encourage this, and the experimentation that leads to the posts, as a way to keep our technical capabilities fresh and to also showcase what we do in a way that goes beyond the typical capabilities statements that exist on every site. My colleagues have been pretty busy but have managed to take some time to write a few posts about their work:</p>

Generally, the systems that are using it are accredited systems of record so a rip-and-replace of Silverlight (or any other component) is simply not feasible without a significant paperwork drill. So we try to help our customers keep those systems as useful for their end users as possible. This post, also by Dan Entzian, illustrates how we did that in one case. A follow up to <a href="http://www.zekiah.com/index.php?q=blog/2011/10/11/exporting-esri-silverlight-graphic-layer-google-earth">an older post</a>, this post was done in response to an e-mail inquiry from a reader of the previous post.</p></li>

This post describes a tool that we developed as part of our overall approach to geospatial data model management. This script generator produces SQL scripts for either <a href="http://postgis.net/">PostGIS</a> or <a href="http://www.gaia-gis.it/gaia-sins/">SpatiaLite</a> that enable a user to create spatial databases that are compliant with a data model. The information for the data model (which is always user-defined, not proscribed by us) is stored in what we call the platform independent model, or <a href="http://www.zekiah.com/index.php?q=blog/topics/pim">PIM</a>. We've used the PIM, its encapsulating API, and tools to good effect for a couple of customers now. This post attempts to provide a concrete picture of what can be an abstract concept.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Since Zekiah is a services company, rather than a platform company, we get to work with a broad range of technologies in support of our customers, in addition to our own internal research. This makes each day pretty interesting and can also make for lively conversation at company events. As the posts above showcase, my colleagues are working on some interesting things and it's a pleasure to work them each day.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The 2014 installment of the <a href="http://www.esri.com/events/federal">Esri Federal GIS Conference</a> (formerly known as the Federal User Conference) happens next week. I have attended the event off and on since its inception. While I originally was drawn by the presence of a large geo-related event in my local area, that gap has been filled by numerous, smaller events from various sources in the past few years. The FedUC has traditionally had something of an identity crisis, with the content often feeling a bit diffuse and somewhat rushed over its quick, two-day schedule.</p>

<p>To Esri's credit, and probably in recognition of the changing economics regarding travel for Federal employees, they have continued to fine-tune the event when they could have easily walked away from it. The main problem with the FedUC is the fact that the Federal Government performs a wide array of functions that are difficult to cover well over two days in a conventional format. Esri has tackled that problem this year with the introduction of <a href="http://www.esri.com/events/federal/agenda/immersion-summits">"immersion summits,"</a> which are three-and-a-half hour sessions dedicated to specific domain areas.</p>

<p>For example, check out the Natural Resources Immersion Summit led by my friend <a href="http://twitter.com/jsteffenson">John Steffenson</a>. The agenda features speakers from USDA, USGS, the US Forest Service, the EPA, the Fish and Wildlife Service, and Department of Interior, representing over 100 years of higher education dedicated to natural resources management. The session also has slots for several demos of systems deployed in natual resources domain.</p>

<p>The session's content seems to be designed take a holistic view, including fiscal, logistical, technical, and demographic challenges among others. This type of deep focus is an intriguing change to event's focus. While nautral resources is not my usual domain, I do like to drop into other sessions as I find that uses cases from other domains can give me ideas to bring back to my work. I think this new format could maximize the use of the compact schedule of the Federal GIS Conference and begin to give the event its own identity.</p>

    <updated>2014-01-08T20:32:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.geomusings.com/2014/01/08/file-geodatabase-compare-tool</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In my work supporting various aspects of geospatial data modeling, I've spent a lot of time delving into concepts around configuration management of such data models. We've been able to apply a core tool set to perform various functions such as version managment, profiling, version-to-version migration, and validation in conjunction with a system we call the platform independent model (PIM). I gave quick overview of the PIM <a href="http://www.zekiah.com/index.php?q=blog/2014/01/02/generating-physical-schemas-pim">in this post over on the Zekiah blog</a> and the complete series on it <a href="http://www.zekiah.com/index.php?q=blog/topics/pim">can be found here</a>.</p>

<p>I've recently spent a bit of time consolidating code after a recent data delivery and decided to post a utility that was an outgrowth of that effort: <a href="https://github.com/Zekiah/ArcGISCompare">a tool to compare schemas of two Esri file geodatabases and report differences</a>. This lent itself to general use because it does not require any connection to a PIM.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://github.com/Zekiah/ArcGISCompare/raw/master/screenshot.png" /></p>

<!--more-->


<p>The PIM deals mainly at the logical level with data models, but a full configuration management workflow must occasionally touch physical data sets. One use case we had to support, for which this tool was built, was the case where users in the field must compare separate data sets for eventual integration. Although these workflows start with a template data set, it is not unusal for changes to be made during collection, resulting in very similar but not identical schemas. This tool helps users identify such differences in order to make configuration management decisions based upon the actual state of the collected data.</p>

<p>The tool is fairly straightforward: choose a template data set, choose an implementation data set, run the compare, and examine the results. It contains ArcObjects dependencies although we may migrate it to the file geodatabase API in order to eliminate those.</p>

<p>We are also in the process of building a similar tool to work with SQLite/SpatiaLite data sets, which is the other format we commonly see used and will post that tool when it is complete. In the meantime, I hope you find this application useful.</p>
