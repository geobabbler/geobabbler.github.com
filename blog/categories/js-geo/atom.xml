    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>UPDATE (12 March 2014):</strong> The situation with JS.GEO 2014 seems to be a bit fluid and the information originally posted here is no longer accurate. As indicated by Steve Citron-Pousty, the current goal is to have the event occur with <a href="https://2014.foss4g.org">FOSS4G in Portland</a>, though that does not appear to have been finalized. In short, don't book travel yet.</p>

<p>Information about the follow-up to last year's <a href="http://www.jsgeo.org/">JS.Geo</a> event has been percolating back-channel for a few weeks now. <del>Now some <a href="http://lanyrd.com/2014/jsgeo14/">official details have been posted</a>. This year's event will be held in April in San Francisco</del>. I attended last year's session, really liked the focused format, and got a lot of good information out of it. One thing that was nice was that, regardless of whether you are of an Esri or open-source persuasion in your development preferences, there was a lot of good information presented with a relative lack of hyperbole, which made it easy to focus on the content.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://blog.geomusings.com/images/posts/jsgeo13.png" /></p>

<p>As <a href="http://twitter.com/geo_rube">Todd Barr</a> <a href="http://drunkengeographer.tumblr.com/post/69908102132/when-i-realize-that-no-one-who-plans-gis-spatial">eloquently points out</a>, the April 2014 calender is somewhat crowded with geo-events but, based on last year's event, I'd recommend putting JS.Geo at the top of the list.</p>
