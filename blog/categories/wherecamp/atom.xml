    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I just got word from <a href="http://twitter.com/tonyquartararo">Anthony Quartararo</a> that the dates for <a href="http://wherecamptb.org/">WhereCampTampaBay</a> have been set for February 10-11, 2012. That seems like a pretty sweet time of year for a weekend in Florida.</p>

<div style="text-align:center;"><img alt="" height="375" src="http://www.qci-online.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/TampaPalms4.jpg" width="500" /><div style="text-align:center;font-size: 14px;">By February, you'll be ready for this.<br/><br/></div></div>


<p>The 10th will feature an IgniteSpatial lightning talk session with the actual unconference happening on the 11th. I had a great time at WhereCampDC back in May and I know Florida has a very active spatial community that deals with a diverse problem set. I think this has the potential to very a very good event.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I just learned from <a href="http://twitter.com/wonderchook">Kate Chapman</a> that the date for <a href="http://wherecampdc.org/">WhereCampDC</a> has been set. It will be Saturday, June 11th. If you are interested in attending, you can register through EventBrite <a href="http://wherecampdc.eventbrite.com/">here</a>. Move fast because it'll probably fill up quickly!</p>

<p>Despite all the of geospatial activity in this region, there has been a dearth of conference activity. The <a href="http://www.esri.com/events/feduc/index.html">Esri FedUC</a> has been the only game in town for years so WhereCampDC is a welcome addition to the scene. Also, the very structured conference environment around here could stand a little injection of "un" into its veins. :)</p>

<p>Oh yeah, there'll be lightning talks on the 10th, too!</p>

<p>See you there!</p>
