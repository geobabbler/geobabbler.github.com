    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In the aftermath of Hurricane Irene, I was trying to get information from my <a href="http://www.smeco.coop">local electric cooperative</a> about outages. There were many (including my neighborhood) and I wanted to see the scale of the problem. It turns out, they have a page with a map that shows current outages by zip code.</p>

<div style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://geobabble.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/smeco_outage.png"><img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-2018" height="202" src="http://geobabble.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/smeco_outage.png?w=300" title="smeco_outage" width="300" /></a><div style="text-align: center; font-size: 14px">Old school outage map<br /></div></div>


<p>It's pretty old-school as far as web maps go but it gets the job done. Their day job is making electricity, not web maps, so I won't critique it too much. One thing I did notice is that the map seems to be dynamically generated (as do the tables on the page) from some inaccessible data source. I search and tried to find some kind of feed, to no avail.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>The data on this page is ideal for an RSS feed which could be consumed by any of the local news portals, online mapping sites, and other outlets that may be used by the public. Yet, there is no feed. Here is an example of useful information locked away behind an uninformed design decision. The organization has already made the decision to publish this information so using RSS or social media would not expose anything more than what is already being released.</p>

<p>It makes me wonder about the scale of this problem. How much more information is being produced in relatively inaccessible forms by otherwise well-intentioned organizations? In this case, the information is being produced as an HTML page, so we can always scrape and republish the information, which is exactly what I did. The resulting feed can be found here:</p>

<p><a href="http://demo.zekiah.com/smecofeed/smeco_outage.xml">http://demo.zekiah.com/smecofeed/smeco_outage.xml</a></p>

<p>The feed is simple: the ZIP code is in the item title and the number households affected is in the item description (by itself with no other decoration). Since ZIP codes are fairly standard, it makes it easy to consume the feed and do other things with it, such as <a href="http://geocommons.com/maps/97440">map it on GeoCommons</a>. This map may seem redundant but now the data can be layered with other data sets such as shelter locations, ice distribution centers and the like, making it more useful.</p>

<p>To produce this feed I used Python. <a href="http://blog.davebouwman.com/">Dave Bouwman</a> pointed me to <a href="http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/">Beautiful Soup</a> and I also made use of the <a href="http://www.crummy.com/software/ScrapeNFeed/">ScrapeNFeed</a> library (which makes use of <a href="http://www.dalkescientific.com/Python/PyRSS2Gen.html">PyRSS2Gen</a>). I have it set up on a cron job to update every two hours and dump a new XML file. I decided this was preferable to doing a direct link back to the page because I'm unsure how robust their server is. I am posting my code below in the event that someone else needs to do this. This type of approach is very fragile. You'll see from the code that it's very dependent upon the structure of the source HTML. So, if the page structure changes, the feed will break. This is obviously not ideal so it's best to view it as a band-aid.</p>

<p>I suspect that there's a lot of this kind of thing going on. Where you find it, it's best to engage with the organization to help make it better and that's my next step here. There's been a lot of talk about open data in our industry for a while, along with a lot of activity. Situations like this make me realize the scale of the work yet to be done. It will take a lot of effort to open up data all the way down the line and, perhaps, even more effort to help organizations understand why it is beneficial to do so in the first place. But it's work that needs to be done.</p>

<p>As promised, here's the Python code should anyone find it useful:</p>

    <link href="http://blog.geomusings.com/2009/11/14/Does-Vendor-Lock-In-Increase-Health-Care-Costs/"/>
    <updated>2009-11-14T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.geomusings.com/2009/11/14/Does-Vendor-Lock-In-Increase-Health-Care-Costs</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today is World Diabetes Day. I am a parent of a child with Type 1 diabetes (also known as juvenile diabetes). As such, my child is dependent upon insulin and will be until a cure is found. I am using my blog today to discuss the issue of interoperability (or lack thereof) of medical devices.<!--more--></p>

<p>My child is primarily dependent upon two medical devices for diabetes management. The first is a blood glucose meter which is used to check blood sugar. The second is an insulin pump which maintains a suitable basal rate of insulin and also helps cover carbohydrate intake at meals. Both devices produce a fair amount of data  that allows us to see what is happening with blood glucose levels and help us make adjustments to keep things going smoothly.</p>

<p>We have a fairly typical setup in which neither of these devices talks to each other so we download data from them into software on our computer. Over the past decade, interoperability has been a leading issue in the geospatial industry. As such, it has made me sensitive to it in other areas, most notably in diabetes management. What I have come to realize is that there is very little in the way of true interoperability in this area and I think it is potentially very relevant to the current discussions of reducing health-care costs. Our case serves as an example:</p>

<p>Each of the devices we use comes with its own software. The software for the glucose monitor allows us to hook the devices up to a USB port and download all of the blood glucose information they contain (we use more than one, all from the same vendor). The insulin pump has a different piece of software that allow us to download information to examine basal rates and boluses in conjunction with blood glucose. It also downloads the meal-time glucose numbers. In order to properly cover for a meal, you must tell the pump what your current glucose is so that information is available for download. The complexity begins here.</p>

<p>Good management of diabetes requires glucose checks throughout the day, not just at mealtime. In order to get a complete picture of what is going on, you must download from the glucose monitor to see all of the information. Our insulin pump software provides the ability to hook up our monitor and download information directly. This gives us that complete picture. The glucose meter software does not allow download from any insulin pumps. It must be entered manually (ugh) or imported from a CSV file. It expects the CSV to be formatted in a way that is not supported by our insulin pump software.</p>

<p>The insulin pump software does not support two of the type of meters that we use, so we cannot download that information into it. What this implies is that, although all of our glucose monitors are from the same vendor, their firmware is sufficiently different to indicate that nothing resembling a standard interface is used. If I use the software for the glucose monitor, I can install a driver update to support new devices from the vendor. These driver updates are not recognized by the insulin pump software.</p>

<p>Why do we use both pieces of software? The glucose monitor software is the only way to get a full picture of the glucose readings. The insulin pump software provides better statistical analysis tools. I need them both and that is my problem. I should be able to simply plug in each device and upload to either piece of software (or some other if I wish). This is a quite solvable problem but the vendors lack any incentive because you become dependent upon their tools.</p>

<p>Over time, devices from different vendors leapfrog each other in capability. A new glucose monitor requires less blood, a new pump gives you more ways to tune basal rates, etc. As you do what is best for your child and get the best devices available, you are faced with the problem of importing and exporting your historical diabetes data between different pieces of software. The importance of this data is such that it can cause people to stick with a single vendor regardless of the cost or effectiveness of the devices.</p>

<p>The interoperability issue concerns me more as closed-loop systems begin to hit the market. These are systems in which the monitor and the pump do talk to each other (usually via signalling) and work together. Some systems feature new continuous glucose monitoring devices (CGM) that constantly sample blood glucose and message the pump to make adjustments. Many of these systems are still waiting for approval. CGMs are new and have issues but we can expect the technology to mature. The leap-frogging process will continue. The problem with closed-loop systems is that I have only seen them discussed in terms of single-vendor solutions. Vendor A's CGM will work in concert with Vendor A's pump but I have seen no evidence that, if Vendor B produces a better CGM, it will be able to work in the closed-loop system. I see this as having the potential to reduce patient choice, suppress demand, reduce negotiating power with vendors and keep costs artificially high.</p>

<p>In the community in which I work my "day job", we think about these issues a lot. I think I was somewhat surprised to see how little these issues seem to be considered in the health industry. Because we deal with diabetes every day, I tend to look at it through that lens but I can imagine that it is pervasive elsewhere. I think this is an area that can and should be looked at as something that has the potential to reduce costs independent of health insurance and the more hotly contested topics in the current debate.</p>

    <id>http://blog.geomusings.com/2009/10/27/What-Is-This-GIS-Of-Which-You-Speak</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://donmeltz.com/blog/index.php/2009/10/25/gis-is-dead-long-live-gis/">Don Meltz</a> has kicked off the most recent round of discussion about the nature/state of ?GIS? (I put that in quotes since I am the one who declared it a myth). <a href="http://blogs.weogeo.com/jamesfee/2009/10/27/spatial-isn%E2%80%99t-special/">James</a> and <a href="http://blog.fortiusone.com/2009/10/27/the-once-and-future-map-the-destiny-of-gis/">Sean</a> also weighed with their thoughts on the subject. Like it or not, they are right. The technology that has for years been labeled as ?GIS? and segmented (somewhat artificially) from the rest of the IT industry is, with increasing speed, being integrated into the tapestry of mainstream IT. This trend is not only something that I think is irreversible and good, it is something that I have been actively working toward for my entire career.<!--more--></p>

<p>The nature of spatial technologies is changing and, in the very near future, it will no longer be sufficient to merely be proficient with such technologies. As a software developer and a consultant, I recognize that it is important to first have expertise in software development tools, patterns and practices in addition to proficiency with spatial tools. It is key to have an understanding of how to appropriately integrate spatial data and methods into a system or application. This may not always mean having a big, pretty map front-and-center in the UI (if you need one at all). Spatial tools have always been great for eye candy but their true power lies in the analytical capability and this capability can add value independent of visualization on a map.</p>

<p>The trend of spatial tools and methods blending into mainstream IT can be seen in the advent of the "neo" approach where slippy maps and the like have grown from web technologies (as opposed to ?web maps? being crammed into pages via ?GIS servers?). They will extend to include more spatial capabilities as the technology advances. Who among us really thought 10 years ago that javascript would be able to handle the things currently being accomplished with jQuery, ExtJS and the like. The same type of evolution in capability will continue and can already be seen in things like GeoExt and the ESRI Javascript API. (The trend exists in other segments as well but I use javascript libraries as an illustration.) Additionally the integration of spatial data and methods at the RDBMS level demonstrates what we all know to be true: spatial data is just another data type and should be treated as such.</p>

<p>I have never really considered "desktop GIS" to be anything more than applications that allow you to make maps and perform spatial analysis. They are part graphics package and part statistics package and part "geography package". To be sure, correct implementation of spatial methods takes a lot of skill. Correct spatial analysis takes a lot of potentially specialized skill. There are multiple kinds of spatial data that have unique properties and techniques. But it is important here to separate the person from the tool, much like engineers use CAD as a tool but it doesn?t define who they are.</p>

<p>I don't think desktop tools will go away in the near future because some spatial operations are too complex or cumbersome to be done "on the fly" at runtime. There are too many cases where data simply needs to be pre-processed and the results used in an application or presented to a user.</p>

<p>But make no mistake that current trends in databases, APIs, servers and "clouds" (forgive my use of shorthand) will continue to the point where the "GIS" components of such systems will be indistinguishable from the rest. Spatial data will be used or presented in an integrated fashion (HTML 5 perhaps?) and users will grow as accustomed it as they have to all of the various effects enabled by AJAX. In short, the current concept of a "geo-stack" will simply give way to a stack that has spatial logic in there if you need it. That's as it should be.</p>

<p>So, in my opinion, it's the technology that's evolving, blending into the background and disappearing. This will have the natural effect of meaning that less "GIS Analysts" will be needed over time but that will happen mostly in areas where the need for them was rather light and necessitated only by artificial boundaries between spatial tools and the rest of the IT environment. Advancements in technology may automate some more advanced applications as well (witness what's happening with feature extraction, for instance).</p>

<p>Ultimately, the point made in other places holds true that proficiency with spatial analysis married with some specific domain knowledge will be key. Proficiency with spatial tools alone will not be compelling skill set. As for the tools themselves, it'll be like they were never there.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Now that the election is behind us, I have a little time to ponder one of my hopes for the future in our little corner of the world. I would really like to see the concept of the binary red-blue election map put out to pasture.<!--more--></p>

<p>The whole concept went viral after the 2000 election as states were colored red or blue depending on who won each state. Since then, the media and our society has taken the idea of red states and blue states and run with it. We may have been on the road to polarization before then but I can't help but think that such a stark visual has helped cement it in people's minds.</p>

<p>Last night, as I watched the election coverage on CNN (yes, I saw the hologram), Bill Bennett commented on how after the 2004 election, a county-by-county view showed a sea of red across the nation with small islands of blue (those were the university towns according to him). This clearly showed that the vast majority of the country was conservative, in his mind. As a "blue" resident of a "red county" in a "blue state", I wanted to throw something at the TV.</p>

<p>Interestingly, later in the same CNN coverage, there was analysis of how Obama was running in Republican counties as compared to Kerry's 2004 performance. In almost all cases, Obama was outperforming Kerry. This discussion began to peel back the onion a little bit by showing that many "red" counties had a lot of "blue" voters.</p>

<p>This strikes to the heart of problem with the binary maps: they mask the true makeup of our country and potentially contribute to polarization. When the media picks up the red/blue analogy and runs with it, it helps to cement the concept. To be fair, there have been attempts at <a href="http://www.princeton.edu/~rvdb/JAVA/election2004/">alternative visualizations</a>. This year, I followed the polling on <a href="http://www.electoral-vote.com">electoral-vote.com</a>, as I did in 2004. That site makes an attempt to show the gradient a little. There were also a few "shades of purple" type maps after the 2004 election. I think this type of visualization should be the norm rather than the exception.</p>

<p>To that end, I offer up two views of my home state of Maryland after yesterday's election. I used SharpMap and the CNN county-by-county results to produce them. The first is the standard red/blue binary view which makes it look like Democrats are being outflanked (the gray county is currently tied):</p>

<p><a href="http://geobabble.files.wordpress.com/2008/11/md_red_blue.gif"><img alt="md_red_blue" class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-355" height="54" src="http://geobabble.files.wordpress.com/2008/11/md_red_blue.gif?w=128" title="md_red_blue" width="128" /></a></p>

<p>The second uses purple gradients to attempt to show the mix of Republican vs. Democrat. I used standard RGB color values and applied the percentage vote for each candidate to weight R and B. G was left at zero. So, in a county where McCain got 58% to Obama's 42%, the RGB value would be (255 * .58, 0, 255 * .42) or 148,0,47. I did not weight the counties according to population. Also, the CNN data did not include votes for third-party candidates so there is no "green" component here.</p>

<p><a href="http://geobabble.files.wordpress.com/2008/11/md_vote_2008_gradient.png"><img alt="2008 Maryland Presidential Results in Gradient" class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-350" height="57" src="http://geobabble.files.wordpress.com/2008/11/md_vote_2008_gradient.png?w=128" title="2008 Maryland Presidential Results in Gradient" width="128" /></a></p>

<p>There are a variety of ways to do this sort of thing that would be better than the binary red-blue maps we have come to know and loath.</p>

<p>Update: BTW, Princeton is already up with result of the 2008 election: <a href="http://www.princeton.edu/~rvdb/JAVA/election2008/">http://www.princeton.edu/~rvdb/JAVA/election2008/</a> . They've been doing this kind of thing for years and have a great time-lapse view. I hope this becomes the prevalent way of looking at it.</p>

<p>Disclaimer: I'm a programmer. I threw these maps together for the purposes of discussion but I'm sure there are numerous better ways to do this. If they ever publish a "Maps That Suck" book, several of my products will probably figure prominently.</p>

    <id>http://blog.geomusings.com/2007/12/05/So-Neo-Geo-Is-Not-GIS-Huh</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://apb.directionsmag.com/archives/3703-Neogeography-is-not-GIS;-not-LI.html">All Points</a> got the ball rolling this time around. <a href="http://geothought.blogspot.com/2007/12/no-data-creation-in-neogeography-errr.html">Peter Batty</a> responded with his usual thoughtfulness and <a href="http://geotips.blogspot.com/2007/12/real-men-use-real-gis-software.html">Paul Ramsey</a> gets the award for the best reponse so far.</p>

<p>I watch this and can't help but wonder: haven't we been here before?</p>

<p>If we replace the phrase "<a href="http://gislounge.com/internet-mapping/google-maps/neogeography/">neogeography</a>" with the phrase "desktop mapping" then I feel like we had this conversation 10 (or more) years ago. The ironic part is that MapInfo was in the position then that neo-geo is in now.</p>

<p>Many GIS hard-liners argued that non-topological mapping packages could not be called GIS. "Real GIS" understood topology and could do analysis based upon topology. That argument was mostly forwarded by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ArcInfo">Arc/Info</a> crowd (although I don't think <a href="http://www.esri.com">ESRI</a> was directly involved, it arose more from Arc/Info adherents). Software such as <a href="http://www.mapinfo.com/location/integration">MapInfo</a>, <a href="http://www.caliper.com/">Maptitude</a>, etc. was not "real GIS" and, therefore, their outputs could not be trusted.</p>

<p>Well, we see what happened: that market proliferated. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ArcView_3.x">ArcView 3.x</a> became the most widely used GIS package around at the time. Other desktop systems (MapInfo, <a href="http://www.manifold.net">Manifold</a>, etc.) beefed up their capabilities and ESRI eventually produced ArcMap. Anyone care to have that conversation again? I didn't think so.</p>

<p>So, is neogeography GIS? I don't know. What's the measure? Those put forth by Mike Hickey are different than those put forth as arguments against desktop mapping years ago. So, really, the hurdle has just been moved. Maybe neo-geo isn't GIS...yet. But does anyone really think the technology won't advance? Take a look at <a href="http://featureserver.org/">FeatureServer</a>. Take a look at the various spatial SQL implementations in <a href="http://postgis.refractions.net">PostGIS</a>, <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/sql/2008/technologies/spatial.mspx">SQL Server 2008</a>, <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technology/products/spatial/index.html">Oracle</a> and many others. People are trying to solve that problem. If ESRI ever puts out their <a href="http://virtualearth4gov.spaces.live.com/Blog/cns!369B39F890CE30C1!408.entry">REST API</a>, the neo-geo community will have the full power (maybe) of ArcGIS Server at their disposal. I have an idea: if MapInfo feels that neo-geo isn't really GIS, why don't they create a product line targeted at giving the neo-geo community "real GIS" tools. Whatever those are. Looks like a market opportunity to me.</p>

<p>Making decisions about the viability/validity of neo-geo based on the current state of the technology is a little short-sighted to say the least.</p>
