    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In the aftermath of Hurricane Irene, I was trying to get information from my <a href="http://www.smeco.coop">local electric cooperative</a> about outages. There were many (including my neighborhood) and I wanted to see the scale of the problem. It turns out, they have a page with a map that shows current outages by zip code.</p>

<div style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://geobabble.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/smeco_outage.png"><img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-2018" height="202" src="http://geobabble.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/smeco_outage.png?w=300" title="smeco_outage" width="300" /></a><div style="text-align: center; font-size: 14px">Old school outage map<br /></div></div>


<p>It's pretty old-school as far as web maps go but it gets the job done. Their day job is making electricity, not web maps, so I won't critique it too much. One thing I did notice is that the map seems to be dynamically generated (as do the tables on the page) from some inaccessible data source. I search and tried to find some kind of feed, to no avail.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>The data on this page is ideal for an RSS feed which could be consumed by any of the local news portals, online mapping sites, and other outlets that may be used by the public. Yet, there is no feed. Here is an example of useful information locked away behind an uninformed design decision. The organization has already made the decision to publish this information so using RSS or social media would not expose anything more than what is already being released.</p>

<p>It makes me wonder about the scale of this problem. How much more information is being produced in relatively inaccessible forms by otherwise well-intentioned organizations? In this case, the information is being produced as an HTML page, so we can always scrape and republish the information, which is exactly what I did. The resulting feed can be found here:</p>

<p><a href="http://demo.zekiah.com/smecofeed/smeco_outage.xml">http://demo.zekiah.com/smecofeed/smeco_outage.xml</a></p>

<p>The feed is simple: the ZIP code is in the item title and the number households affected is in the item description (by itself with no other decoration). Since ZIP codes are fairly standard, it makes it easy to consume the feed and do other things with it, such as <a href="http://geocommons.com/maps/97440">map it on GeoCommons</a>. This map may seem redundant but now the data can be layered with other data sets such as shelter locations, ice distribution centers and the like, making it more useful.</p>

<p>To produce this feed I used Python. <a href="http://blog.davebouwman.com/">Dave Bouwman</a> pointed me to <a href="http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/">Beautiful Soup</a> and I also made use of the <a href="http://www.crummy.com/software/ScrapeNFeed/">ScrapeNFeed</a> library (which makes use of <a href="http://www.dalkescientific.com/Python/PyRSS2Gen.html">PyRSS2Gen</a>). I have it set up on a cron job to update every two hours and dump a new XML file. I decided this was preferable to doing a direct link back to the page because I'm unsure how robust their server is. I am posting my code below in the event that someone else needs to do this. This type of approach is very fragile. You'll see from the code that it's very dependent upon the structure of the source HTML. So, if the page structure changes, the feed will break. This is obviously not ideal so it's best to view it as a band-aid.</p>

<p>I suspect that there's a lot of this kind of thing going on. Where you find it, it's best to engage with the organization to help make it better and that's my next step here. There's been a lot of talk about open data in our industry for a while, along with a lot of activity. Situations like this make me realize the scale of the work yet to be done. It will take a lot of effort to open up data all the way down the line and, perhaps, even more effort to help organizations understand why it is beneficial to do so in the first place. But it's work that needs to be done.</p>

<p>As promised, here's the Python code should anyone find it useful:</p>

    <link href="http://blog.geomusings.com/2007/12/05/So-Neo-Geo-Is-Not-GIS-Huh/"/>
    <updated>2007-12-05T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.geomusings.com/2007/12/05/So-Neo-Geo-Is-Not-GIS-Huh</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://apb.directionsmag.com/archives/3703-Neogeography-is-not-GIS;-not-LI.html">All Points</a> got the ball rolling this time around. <a href="http://geothought.blogspot.com/2007/12/no-data-creation-in-neogeography-errr.html">Peter Batty</a> responded with his usual thoughtfulness and <a href="http://geotips.blogspot.com/2007/12/real-men-use-real-gis-software.html">Paul Ramsey</a> gets the award for the best reponse so far.</p>

<p>I watch this and can't help but wonder: haven't we been here before?</p>

<p>If we replace the phrase "<a href="http://gislounge.com/internet-mapping/google-maps/neogeography/">neogeography</a>" with the phrase "desktop mapping" then I feel like we had this conversation 10 (or more) years ago. The ironic part is that MapInfo was in the position then that neo-geo is in now.</p>

<p>Many GIS hard-liners argued that non-topological mapping packages could not be called GIS. "Real GIS" understood topology and could do analysis based upon topology. That argument was mostly forwarded by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ArcInfo">Arc/Info</a> crowd (although I don't think <a href="http://www.esri.com">ESRI</a> was directly involved, it arose more from Arc/Info adherents). Software such as <a href="http://www.mapinfo.com/location/integration">MapInfo</a>, <a href="http://www.caliper.com/">Maptitude</a>, etc. was not "real GIS" and, therefore, their outputs could not be trusted.</p>

<p>Well, we see what happened: that market proliferated. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ArcView_3.x">ArcView 3.x</a> became the most widely used GIS package around at the time. Other desktop systems (MapInfo, <a href="http://www.manifold.net">Manifold</a>, etc.) beefed up their capabilities and ESRI eventually produced ArcMap. Anyone care to have that conversation again? I didn't think so.</p>

<p>So, is neogeography GIS? I don't know. What's the measure? Those put forth by Mike Hickey are different than those put forth as arguments against desktop mapping years ago. So, really, the hurdle has just been moved. Maybe neo-geo isn't GIS...yet. But does anyone really think the technology won't advance? Take a look at <a href="http://featureserver.org/">FeatureServer</a>. Take a look at the various spatial SQL implementations in <a href="http://postgis.refractions.net">PostGIS</a>, <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/sql/2008/technologies/spatial.mspx">SQL Server 2008</a>, <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technology/products/spatial/index.html">Oracle</a> and many others. People are trying to solve that problem. If ESRI ever puts out their <a href="http://virtualearth4gov.spaces.live.com/Blog/cns!369B39F890CE30C1!408.entry">REST API</a>, the neo-geo community will have the full power (maybe) of ArcGIS Server at their disposal. I have an idea: if MapInfo feels that neo-geo isn't really GIS, why don't they create a product line targeted at giving the neo-geo community "real GIS" tools. Whatever those are. Looks like a market opportunity to me.</p>

<p>Making decisions about the viability/validity of neo-geo based on the current state of the technology is a little short-sighted to say the least.</p>

    <updated>2007-10-08T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.geomusings.com/2007/10/08/Up-On-the-Soapbox</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://apb.directionsmag.com/archives/3441-NPR-on-Withholding-Critical-Infrastructure-Data.html">This one</a> caught my eye when it came across Planet GS so I listened to the referenced piece.</p>

<p>Suffice it so say that I've been kind of close to this issue (more so in the past than I am now) and this kind of thing just really burns my arse.</p>

<p>I am less inclined to follow the line of logic that local officials are holding this data close as a means of accumulating power, although it certainly could lead to that. My experience is that most people are genuinely concerned about what they can do the keep their citizens safe while also providing good service.</p>

<p>Sean Gorman makes the dead-on point that geospatial data is proliferating rapidly and that it will overwhelm efforts to hold it back. It's great that the town GIS staff doesn't want to release manhole data but it's really kind of moot when I can take a photo of them with my GPS-enabled phone.</p>

<p>The most salient point of the whole piece is made at the end when it is pointed out that there are no national guidelines in place governing the release of such information. Some areas make it available online. Others (like Greenwich, CT apparently) release nothing. This is exactly the kind of thing that DHS should be tackling but isn't and hasn't (and probably won't). Apparently, six years isn't enough.</p>

<p>As has been said about other issues, the people who want to do harm will find a way to get this information. Stances like that taken by Greenwich will only hamper law-abiding citizens with legitimate uses for the data. A structured process with appropriate checks in place will provide access to it in a way that minimizes (but never eliminates, because you can't) risk.</p>

<p>Lacking any real guidance (and state, local and private infrastructure managers have been seeking guidance for years), the city of Greenwich can't really be faulted. These are tough issues that don't have easy solutions. Meanwhile, technology marches on. Maybe it's time to get off the starting block.</p>
