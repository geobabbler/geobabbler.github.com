    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Atanas' daughter, Christina, is now using his Twitter account to get information out. In addition, she posted a <a href="http://www.tenthcave.com/2011/10/plea-for-help.html">message from Atanas</a> on his blog. He and his son are currently being detained. Also, please see the comment stream to John's post (link below) for additional information about sending letters of support. Letters that are not signed may no be considered so, if sending an e-mail, be sure to send a signed, scanned copy as an attachment.</p>

<hr />


<p><a href="http://njgeo.org/2011/10/17/colleague-in-need-atanas-entchev/">John Reiser posted this piece</a> on the situation of our colleague, Atanas Entchev. Atanas, a native of Bulgaria, came to the United States in 1991, followed soon thereafter by his family. They applied for asylum and have been in litigation regarding their status ever since. The latest opinion, filed on June 23, 2011 by the US Third Circuit Court of Appeals <a href="http://www.ca3.uscourts.gov/opinarch/104369np.pdf">may be found here</a> (.pdf). Says John:</p>

<blockquote>
After emigrating here with his family over twenty years ago to escape political persecution, the US Government is now planning to deport the Entchevs.
</blockquote>


<p>My dealings with Atanas have been almost exclusively through social media channels and I have never met him in person. Despite that, I feel I know him as a result of his open participation in those arenas. His knowledge of the applications of GIS, especially at the municipal level, is top-notch. His contributions to the GIS community, such as the publications listed in his <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=8637855&amp;authType=name&amp;authToken=eUA1&amp;locale=en_US&amp;pvs=pp&amp;trk=ppro_viewmore">LinkedIn profile</a>, as well as his <a href="http://www.directionsmag.com/authors/atanas-entchev/121956">contributions to Directions Magazine</a> and his <a href="http://blog.entchev.com/">blog</a> demonstrate active engagement in his (our) professional community. He is also a small business owner, having founded <a href="http://entchev.com/index.htm">his own GIS services company</a> in 2005.</p>

<p>Of course, legal opinions are only meant to focus on relevant law. As a result, this tapestry of the Entchevs life in America becomes obscured. At one point, the opinion says (LPR = Legal Permanent Resident):</p>

<blockquote>
Although the daughter's adjustment to LPR status may slightly strengthen Entchev's ties to the community, and as a matter of discretion the Department of State may therefore be more inclined to grant a waiver, it is far from clear that the status of Entchev's daughter as an LPR would result in a different outcome for a new waiver application.
</blockquote>


<p>Not being a lawyer, I can't comment on the legal content but this is a very sterile reduction of the Entchevs' life. Those of us who have been linked to Atanas through social media know of his love of sailing, tennis and biking and have seen photos of the Entchevs enjoying the arts around the New York region. So, during two decades of litigation, the legal merits of which have left the Third Circuit Court of Appeals unmoved, the Entchevs have built a rich, textured, wholly American life.</p>

<p>As Atanas's wife Mayia says:</p>

<blockquote>
If you are willing and able to write a letter of recommendation, your contribution will be invaluable to our case, and would be greatly appreciated by our family.
</blockquote>


<p>If you know Atanas, please take time to write a letter in support of him and his family. Instructions are in John's post.</p>

    <link href="http://blog.geomusings.com/2011/08/30/Prying-Data-Open/"/>
    <updated>2011-08-30T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.geomusings.com/2011/08/30/Prying-Data-Open</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In the aftermath of Hurricane Irene, I was trying to get information from my <a href="http://www.smeco.coop">local electric cooperative</a> about outages. There were many (including my neighborhood) and I wanted to see the scale of the problem. It turns out, they have a page with a map that shows current outages by zip code.</p>

<div style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://geobabble.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/smeco_outage.png"><img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-2018" height="202" src="http://geobabble.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/smeco_outage.png?w=300" title="smeco_outage" width="300" /></a><div style="text-align: center; font-size: 14px">Old school outage map<br /></div></div>


<p>It's pretty old-school as far as web maps go but it gets the job done. Their day job is making electricity, not web maps, so I won't critique it too much. One thing I did notice is that the map seems to be dynamically generated (as do the tables on the page) from some inaccessible data source. I search and tried to find some kind of feed, to no avail.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>The data on this page is ideal for an RSS feed which could be consumed by any of the local news portals, online mapping sites, and other outlets that may be used by the public. Yet, there is no feed. Here is an example of useful information locked away behind an uninformed design decision. The organization has already made the decision to publish this information so using RSS or social media would not expose anything more than what is already being released.</p>

<p>It makes me wonder about the scale of this problem. How much more information is being produced in relatively inaccessible forms by otherwise well-intentioned organizations? In this case, the information is being produced as an HTML page, so we can always scrape and republish the information, which is exactly what I did. The resulting feed can be found here:</p>

<p><a href="http://demo.zekiah.com/smecofeed/smeco_outage.xml">http://demo.zekiah.com/smecofeed/smeco_outage.xml</a></p>

<p>The feed is simple: the ZIP code is in the item title and the number households affected is in the item description (by itself with no other decoration). Since ZIP codes are fairly standard, it makes it easy to consume the feed and do other things with it, such as <a href="http://geocommons.com/maps/97440">map it on GeoCommons</a>. This map may seem redundant but now the data can be layered with other data sets such as shelter locations, ice distribution centers and the like, making it more useful.</p>

<p>To produce this feed I used Python. <a href="http://blog.davebouwman.com/">Dave Bouwman</a> pointed me to <a href="http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/">Beautiful Soup</a> and I also made use of the <a href="http://www.crummy.com/software/ScrapeNFeed/">ScrapeNFeed</a> library (which makes use of <a href="http://www.dalkescientific.com/Python/PyRSS2Gen.html">PyRSS2Gen</a>). I have it set up on a cron job to update every two hours and dump a new XML file. I decided this was preferable to doing a direct link back to the page because I'm unsure how robust their server is. I am posting my code below in the event that someone else needs to do this. This type of approach is very fragile. You'll see from the code that it's very dependent upon the structure of the source HTML. So, if the page structure changes, the feed will break. This is obviously not ideal so it's best to view it as a band-aid.</p>

<p>I suspect that there's a lot of this kind of thing going on. Where you find it, it's best to engage with the organization to help make it better and that's my next step here. There's been a lot of talk about open data in our industry for a while, along with a lot of activity. Situations like this make me realize the scale of the work yet to be done. It will take a lot of effort to open up data all the way down the line and, perhaps, even more effort to help organizations understand why it is beneficial to do so in the first place. But it's work that needs to be done.</p>

<p>As promised, here's the Python code should anyone find it useful:</p>

    <id>http://blog.geomusings.com/2011/08/24/Critical-Infrastructure</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A couple of weeks ago, I took some gentle razzing from some quarters for admitting I still have a land line:</p>

<p><div class='embed tweet'><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>As actual voice communication devices, mobile phones still suck. This why I still have a land line. <a href="https://twitter.com/search/%23oldtechthatworks">#oldtechthatworks</a></p>&mdash; Bill Dollins (@billdollins) <a href="https://twitter.com/billdollins/status/102403900207935488" data-datetime="2011-08-13T15:39:27+00:00">August 13, 2011</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div></p>

<p>This tweet was the result of yet another dropped call, which is annoying, but the unreliability of cellular networks can be more than just annoying, especially given the fact that they are now the primary communications medium for many people.</p>

<p>Almost ten years ago, on September 11, 2001, I was being evacuated from the building I was in and was trying reach my wife via cell phone. I heard a few garbled words about my parents and our dog before the line went dead. The mobile phone network was down for quite a while and my old analog cell phone was a paperweight during that time. We met up at my parents house later and she had our son and dog with her.</p>

<p>I went on to spend the next several years closely involved with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_infrastructure">critical infrastructure</a> protection efforts and, specifically, the application of geospatial tools to those efforts. A lot of time, effort and money has been invested to make sure infrastructure works better in such situations.</p>

<p>Flash forward to yesterday's <a href="http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/recenteqsus/Quakes/se082311a.php">earthquake in Virginia</a>. As the earthquake hit, we went outside. I pulled out my cell phone to call my wife and got nothing. Simultaneously, everyone in the parking lot with me started noting that they couldn't get a call through. Ten years later and I was standing at square one, holding a paperweight. I could, however, use my data plan to get to <a href="http://twitter.com">Twitter</a> and <a href="http://www.facebook.com">Facebook</a>. I don't for a moment imagine that data services are more stable. Instead, I suspect that the fact that I could use data services is more of an indication of how few people actually use smartphones or data plans.</p>

<p>The earthquake was relatively mild (although such distinctions are different in the East for a number of reasons) and I went back inside after 10 minutes, where I was able to communicate with my family and others via Facebook, Twitter and, yes, land line. It was an hour before I could make a call on my mobile (I have Verizon but AT&amp;T users were also having trouble). So, until there are significant changes, this will remain a fixture in my house:</p>

<p>This sits in our office at home and may be older than I am. It has provided communication through <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_11_attacks">attacks</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Isabel">hurricanes</a>, <a href="http://www.erh.noaa.gov/lwx/Historic_Events/apr28-2002/laplata.htm">tornadoes</a> and, now, an earthquake and it works when there is no power.</p>

<p>I am certain that government and emergency responders had access to the communications they required but it's amazing to think that the most reliable forms of communication available to citizens at large may be two free social media networks that didn't exist ten years ago and a form of technology that's over a century old.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I was reading Brian Timoney's excellent post "<a href="http://mapbrief.com/2011/06/29/open-government-is-a-slammed-door-at-the-blm/">Open Government is a Slammed Door at the BLM</a>," when I encountered this line:</p>

<blockquote>
Top-down, large scale spatial-data-integration-by-directive simply doesn?t have the track record of success to justify the costs...
</blockquote>


<p>This resonates well with observations that I have made during the course of my recent work with the <a href="http://www.gis.arkansas.gov/">Arkansas GIO</a> office. The immediate focus of that work was to help AGIO assess the current state of their <a href="http://www.geostor.arkansas.gov/G6/Home.html">GeoStor</a> platform and gather data about current and emerging capabilities in order to support decision-making about whether to migrate to a hosted (cloud) environment. In the course of doing that work, I learned about the collaborative approach AGIO has taken with the cities and counties of Arkansas, which also informs some of the functional requirements of GeoStor.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>AGIO, among many other functions, offers state-wide, seamless data sets for streets, parcels and addresses. These data sets are assembled from county/city data and allow GeoStor to feature a highly accurate geocoding service, which serves as a resource to support requirements such as <a href="http://www.streamlinedsalestax.org/">streamlined sales tax</a> and others. AGIO feels that commercial geocoding engines do not provide enough accuracy to support these types of requirements so they use detailed data from local jurisdictions to build one for the State.</p>

<p>What I came to understand is that AGIO integrates these data sets in the absence of any top-down requirement of the kind Brian mentions in his post. In general, they take the data as it comes (format, schema, etc.) and use automated/manual processes to transform the data and build/update the data sets. Using this "light touch" approach, AGIO receives data from all 75 counties in the State.</p>

<p>This arrangement works because AGIO views GeoStor as a state-wide asset that must be able to provide value back to the localities as well as to individual citizens. Local jurisdictions can store/host their data on GeoStor. They can also make use of the platform to host map viewers and applications. For instance, the <a href="http://bit.ly/k4f4Ae">Saline County Assessor's Viewer</a> is hosted on the GeoStor platform. So that geocoder can be used by the localities for their own needs without needing to build and maintain their own. Another example is the <a href="http://www.geostor.arkansas.gov/G6/Home.html">GeoStor search tool</a>, which can be used to expose any asset registered with GeoStor (local or linked). This search engine becomes a single point of entry that counties can use to expose their own products and services.</p>

<p>And, again, all of this works without a top-down approach of "integration-by-directive," as Brian puts it. When I asked <a href="http://twitter.com/learondalby">Learon Dalby</a> about this approach, he cited minimal impact on counties and value-add, among others, as two important core values that inform the work AGIO does. This approach requires a lot of leg work. Staff visit the counties and AGIO seems to be remarkably in touch with the needs at that level. Basically, all participants get something of value out of the arrangement and the citizens of Arkansas benefit from the collaboration.</p>

<p>This approach stands in stark contrast to much-less-successful efforts I have witnessed at the Federal level. Through my participation in various working groups over the years I have seen numerous top-down efforts fail. Commonly, this is because they offer a data standard that legislates both content and structure. Oftentimes, these standards to do not mesh well with data that is already in place at lower echelons so additional collection/validation/conversion procedures are required, leading to increased complexity and "discussions" over who will fund/execute that additional complexity. Since complexity usually translates into dollars, the stream of vendors and integrators with solutions to mitigate that complexity soon follows.</p>

<p>Another situation I have commonly observed in such efforts, especially those that attempt to get data from the state level up to the Federal level, is a lack of perceived value by the state-level data providers. Often, they feel they do not see value flow back down. They see high-quality data go in and little, if anything, come back out. This is often obscured by nebulous policy or security requirements but almost universally leads to frustration.</p>

<p>Which brings me back to the Arkansas model. The minimization of top-down requirements and the focus on providing clear value (which doesn't always need to be realized in dollars) to all participants are key reasons why it works. A straw-man that is often tossed out in working groups is "Will it scale?" That's a non-factor here. With 75 counties participating, it is already operating at scale. Here, I am not referring to data. Scaling data is easy. Scaling relationships and participation is harder. Processes that impose little overhead scale better. AGIO succeeds by knowing their mission and pushing down as few requirements and as much value as possible.</p>

<p>If the Federal government (including the defense and homeland security sectors) ever gets serious about "open government," "open data," data sharing and other such efforts, it might be worth a trip to Arkansas.</p>
