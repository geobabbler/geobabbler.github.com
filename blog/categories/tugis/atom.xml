    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Just a quick note to tidy up some loose ends related to recent posts...</p>

<p>First, regarding the post "<a href="http://blog.geomusings.com/2013/03/17/a-lazyweb-compendium-of-python-resources-for-beginners/">A #LazyWeb Compendium of Python Resources for Beginners</a>," the University of South Florida PyBulls Python interest group, as promised, compiled a list of Python resources and posted it <a href="https://github.com/PyBulls/learning-resources">on their GitHub page</a>. Thanks to them for their quick response.</p>

<p>Second, following up on the post "<a href="http://blog.geomusings.com/2013/03/20/the-best-thing-i-saw-at-tugis-2013/">The Best Thing I Saw at TUGIS 2013</a>," the data and workbooks for Dr. Arthur Lembo's introduction to open-source GIS have been made available. The data <a href="https://github.com/esrgc/qgistraining">can be found on GitHub</a> and the workbooks can be found on the <a href="http://www.esrgc.org/training/">Eastern Shore Regional GIS Cooperative web site</a>. Many thanks for contributing these resources.</p>

<p>These items are embedded in the comments for their respective posts but I thought it would be useful to call them out more prominently.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I spent the day yesterday at <a href="http://www.towson.edu/">Towson University</a> attending the <a href="http://www.towson.edu/tugis/">TUGIS 2013</a> conference. The new one-day format was a firehose that showcased the diversity of geospatial work occurring across the State of Maryland. The keynote by <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=44978536">Learon Dalby</a> was well-received and the content of the conference was generally substantive. While the day was a sprint, there was one workshop that really caught my attention more so than I would have thought from its title.</p>

<p>The photo below shows 40 participants of an "Introduction to Free and Open Source GIS Software" workshop getting hands-on experience with <a href="http://www.qgis.org">QGIS</a> and <a href="http://www.postgis.org">PostGIS</a> by working through prepared but realistic scenarios. These scenarios included doing multi-user editing and performing spatial analysis to assess the effects of a potential toxic release over a small town.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"> <img src="http://blog.geomusings.com/images/posts/tugis2013_workshop.jpg" /></p>

<p>The workshop was put together by <a href="http://faculty.salisbury.edu/~ajlembo/">Dr. Arthur Lembo</a> of <a href="http://www.salisbury.edu/">Salisbury University</a> and conducted by him and a team of his students, who not only led portions of the workshop but were also stationed around the room to provide guidance to participants. The scenarios were prepared in printed workbooks that the participants were free to take with them, along with information about how to download the tools. All-in-all, I thought the workshop was very well-designed and presented a thorough overview of the capabilities of these two tools.</p>

<p>To be sure, the workshop was not all unicorns and rainbows. There were typical glitches such as file system and database permission issues that required on-the-fly adjustments, which Dr. Lembo and his students handled well. Some participants were clearly stumped at points while others were making good headway with the examples.</p>

<p>Many of the participants probably remain committed <a href="http://www.esri.com">ArcGIS</a> users after the workshop while others may very well dig in and more thoroughly explore QGIS and PostGIS, but that's really beside the point. Regardless of what the individual participants decide to do with the information from the workshop, all left with hands-on exposure to the tools that was presented in a manner that was free of hyperbole, FUD, or market-speak. They now have more first-hand information with which to make their own educated decisions as to how they want to proceed with their geospatial technology choices; and that, in my opinion, may have been the most valuable outcome of the workshop.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Tomorrow, I'll be heading up to the <a href="http://www.towson.edu/tugis/">Towson University GIS (TUGIS) conference</a> with 500 or so of my closest Maryland geo-friends. It has been restructured into a one-day event and the program seems to be very content-rich as a result. I am particularly happy to see more open-source content this year. There's an intro session featuring <a href="http://www.postgresql.org">PostgreSQL</a>, <a href="http://www.postgis.org">PostGIS</a>, <a href="http://qgis.org">QGIS</a>, and <a href="http://geoserver.org">GeoServer</a> presented by <a href="http://www.salisbury.edu/">Salisbury State University</a>. Salisbury was once known as a bastion of <a href="http://www.manifold.net/">Manifold</a> so they've got a long history of thinking outside the Arc. Additionally, there is a session (by Towson University) discussing the use of <a href="http://www.gdal.org">GDAL</a>, <a href="http://www.gdal.org/ogr/">OGR</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/sgillies/shapely">Shapely</a> in the development of a spatial service.</p>

<p>One thing I like about regional GIS conferences like this is that they tend to focus more on solutions to real-world problems instead of the latest technological bells and whistles. I spend so much of my time with my head in Federal requirements that it's nice do a reset and get different perspectives on how geospatial technologies are used. I am particularly interested to hear the keynote from <a href="http://twitter.com/learondalby">Learon Dalby</a> of <a href="http://www.sanborn.com/">Sanborn</a> and formerly of the <a href="http://www.gis.state.ar.us/">Arkansas GIO office</a>. I had the pleasure of working with Learon and the AGIO team on a project a couple of years ago and am impressed with what they accomplished.</p>

<p>I appreciate the new format of TUGIS as a one-day event is much easier to fit into the schedule. I'm looking forward to it.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There was a time only a few years ago when, if you lived in the DC/MD/VA area, planning your geo-conference schedule for the year went something like this: Register for the ESRI FedUC and then start booking plane tickets for everything else. That is no longer the case with more events occurring in the area. Here's a round-up of a few events that are on my 2012 schedule so far:</p>

<div style="text-align:center;"><img alt="" height="536" src="http://geobabble.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/foss4g_lanyard_small.png" title="foss4g_lanyard_small" width="495" /><div style="text-align:center;font-size: 14px;">You can never have too many of these...<br/><br/></div></div>


<p><a href="http://www.esri.com/events/fedcon/index.html">ESRI Federal GIS Conference</a> (formerly known as the Federal User Conference): 22 - 24 February. This is probably one of the longest-running and largest events in the area. This year features another <a href="http://www.esri.com/events/fedcon/agenda/dev-geo.html">DevGeo</a> session, focusing on developing applications with the various ESRI tools. Last year was the first time it was done at a FedUC and the room was packed all day. This conference is obviously an ESRI show but the last few years have included unofficial, after-hours gatherings of people working with a wide range of geospatial tools. Even if you are not an ESRI user, there may be something going on in the vicinity that would be worthwhile. <!--more--></p>

<p><a href="http://www.towson.edu/tugis/">TUGIS 2012</a>: 19 - 20 March. I hesitated to list this because the last thing you want to do is suggest to someone from Baltimore that they are in the DC area. So let me clarify: This is NOT technically a DC-area event but it draws a lot of attendees from the DC area. It's also probably the longest running GIS-related event in the region, celebrating its 25th year this year. The organizers at Towson do a good job of mixing up the program so it's not as overtly "Federal" as events farther down I-95 can be.</p>

<p><a href="http://foss4g-na.org/">FOSS4G North America</a>: 10 - 12 April. This event was the topic of my <a href="http://blog.geomusings.com/2012/01/23/foss4g-north-america-to-be-held-in-washington-dc/">previous post</a>. Clearly, it's intended to be a North American event and I would expect it to move around year-to-year so I'll just be happy for the good fortune that <a href="http://www.osgeo.org/">OSGEO</a> decided to inaugurate it in my back yard. It makes perfect sense as there is growing interest in, and adoption of, open-source geospatial tools in the Federal Government.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.wherecampdc.org/">WhereCampDC 2012</a>: Dates TBD. <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/kelsosCorner/status/156469857704083457">I have heard rumblings</a> but haven't seen details. Last year's event was great and I hope it is reprised this year.</p>

<p>There are also a couple of interesting recurring events that have taken root in the area:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.meetup.com/Geo-DC/">Geo DC Meetups</a> - This is an independent group that meets the first Wednesday of every month and covers a wide range of topics. Given that I live out in the provinces, I don't get into the city as much as I would like for these but the group has been gaining momentum. It seems to be doing a good job of building a community of geo-minded people in the area.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.meetup.com/DevMeetUpNortheast/">ESRI Dev Meetups</a>: These meetups are ostensibly focused on application development with ESRI tools but, in practice, the content of the talks cover a wide variety of issues and tools. There have been talks regarding integration of ESRI tools with other geospatial platforms, best practices, case studies, etc. The nice part about these events is that ESRI doesn't want their staff doing the talking. They just book the venue and put out the refreshments. These meetups occur as part of ESRI's Northeast regional effort to establish these events so they don't occur as frequently as the Geo DC events.</p>

<p>This level of activity in the region is good to see as the potential for a vibrant community has always been there. There are lots of people involved in making this happen but the people at <a href="http://developmentseed.org/">Development Seed</a>, <a href="http://www.geoiq.com">GeoIQ</a> and <a href="http://www.esri.com">ESRI</a> have been particularly proactive in energizing their respective constituencies and the results seem to be beneficial for all.</p>
