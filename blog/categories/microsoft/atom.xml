    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I've become very enamoured of the new VE-based map display at weather.com. For example, <a href="http://www.weather.com/outlook/homeandgarden/home/map/interactive/20622?from=36hour_map_large&amp;zoom=7&amp;interactiveMapLayer=radar">here's my location</a>. My wife had to drive out to Ohio yesterday and, with the big storm moving across the country, I've been spending more time at weather.com than usual.</p>

<p>Anyway, one of the most useful features of the display, from an interactive mapping standpoint, is one that seems rather innocuous. It's the little crosshair in the center of the map. This is the point that you'll zoom in to as you use the slider bar. You'll notice it here:</p>

<p><a href="http://geobabble.files.wordpress.com/2007/04/ve_crosshair.png" title="I guess vacation is over?"><img alt="I guess vacation is over?" src="http://blog.geomusings.com/files/2007/04/ve_crosshair.thumbnail.png" /></a></p>

<p>My issue with the "slider bar" approach to zooming has always been how you have to eyeball your location to the center and then readjust as you zoom in. This one little feature has virtually eliminated the need to for me to do that. So that's the simple little detail that's making me happy today.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Okay, this really has nothing to do with GIS but I wanted to get this info out there. I have a particular piece of software that I use regularly that involves connecting a device to my PC to exchange information. This software does not work with IE7 yet. Since automatic updates doesn't really give you any choice in the matter (I love coming down in the morning and finding a new browser), this created a problem for me.</p>

<p>I found the following software that lets you install previous version of IE in standalone mode: <a href="http://tredosoft.com/Multiple_IE">http://tredosoft.com/Multiple_IE</a>. I imagine it may have applicability for testing and such but it also solved my problem.</p>
