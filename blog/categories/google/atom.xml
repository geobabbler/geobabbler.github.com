    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A few days ago, <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/MichaelShean" target="_blank">Michael Shean</a> of the <a href="http://www.mncppc.org/Commission_Home.html" target="_blank">Maryland-National Capital Parks and Planning Commission</a> (M-NCPPC) announced the availability of videos of 3-D terrain models created to support Planning Board activities in <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?hl=en&amp;cp=26&amp;gs_id=7&amp;xhr=t&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_qf.,cf.osb&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=638&amp;ion=1&amp;q=prince+george's+county&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=0x89b64bcdfea9f6a7:0x68f24b5f98fbb7fc,Prince+George's,+MD&amp;gl=us&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=1FzjT_H1Iq-t0AHasqikAw&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CJABELYD" target="_blank">Prince George's County, Maryland</a>. The videos have been made available via Google+ here: <a href="https://plus.google.com/105701421300090504528/posts" target="_blank">https://plus.google.com/105701421300090504528/posts</a>.</p>

<p>I followed up to inquire how the models were created. M-NCPPC analyst Chris Rotondo gave me the following information:</p>

<blockquote>"We build our 3D models in Google SketchUp, using measurements from the site plan images submitted by the developers. Their architectural elevation images are also the source for our model textures. The building model is then loaded into Google Earth Pro, where we complete the scene by adding simple models of adjacent 3D buildings (based on our LiDAR data) and landscaping. We use the video capture tool within Google Earth Pro to record a video showing all perspectives of the potential development, and the same video that is presented to the Prince George?s County Planning Board is the one available on our Google Plus website. We have also worked with ESRI ArcScene 10 to create more complex terrain models and perform 3D viewshed analysis."</blockquote>


<p>The use of <a href="http://www.google.com/earth/index.html" target="_blank">Google</a> (and/or <a href="http://sketchup.google.com/" target="_blank">Trimble</a>) and <a href="http://www.esri.com" target="_blank">Esri</a> tools in combination is a theme I see popping up more often in all levels of government. Many shops have long-standing Esri-based workflows but the power of Google for information dissemination and visualization is proving compelling. M-NCPPC does a good job here of making use of both to create good visualizations in support of their core mission. Additionally, I really like the use of a social media channel for dissemination and I'd love to learn more about what drove the decision to use <a href="http://plus.google.com" target="_blank">Google+</a> as opposed to some other channel. (I have no issues with Google+, but am curious what drivers affected the choice.)</p>

<p>This is a great example of the kind work many local governments are doing every day with traditional as well as not-so-traditional geospatial tools. Kudos to the Planning Department GIS staff at M-NCPPC.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I read <a href="http://www.gisuser.com/content/view/23022/222/">Learon Dalby's latest GISuser.com expert column</a> (disclosure: I am a contributor there also) with great interest since it addresses an issue with which I have worked closely over the years: availability of GIS data in a time of crisis. Over the years, the proliferation of "operating pictures" (you're not in style unless you have your own <a href="http://www.mitre.org/work/tech_papers/tech_papers_07/07_0093/">UDOP</a>) and other systems has obscured the fact that the data is really what matters. Certain segments of the community, especially those more focused on man-made disasters rather than the natural variety, have gotten very good at putting multiple layers of technology, services, security, policy, etc. between GIS data and the people who need it. <!--more--></p>

<p>The problem with with all of this is that these systems tend to be very fragile under stress (exactly the kinds of stress that one can expect during an actual crisis). To mitigate that, we add scalability, complexity and cost to build out large, highly-available systems to serve out a small amount of data.</p>

<div style="text-align:center;"><img alt="" height="278" src="http://geobabble.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/buffet.png" title="Is it this easy to get to your GIS data?" width="416" /><div style="text-align:center;font-size: 14px;">Is it this easy to get to your GIS data?<br/><br/></div></div>


<p>As Learon and Arkansas demonstrate, there is another approach and it is simply making GIS data as open and <em>directly</em> available as possible. This isn't always sexy (Shapefiles via FTP?!?!) but can be effective. Additionally, it touches upon <a href="http://geobabble.wordpress.com/2010/09/16/be-the-crowd/">an issue I raised last year</a>. Some of the best GIS data in existence is that which is created and maintained at the local government level (one might even call it "authoritative"), but that data is not always available. Arkansas is very realistic when they say that people most likely won't look to their GIS servers first and so they try to push that data to the places people will go to look (<a href="http://maps.google.com">Google</a>, <a href="http://www.bing.com/maps/">Bing</a>, <a href="http://geocommons.com/search?model=&amp;query=AGIO">GeoCommons</a>, <a href="http://www.esri.com">Esri</a>, <a href="http://www.mapquest.com/">MapQuest</a>) in formats that are the most universally accessible (shapefiles, KML, ATOM).</p>

<p>This is a low-level, and somewhat low-tech, form of data sharing and interoperability but, in a time of extended economic stress, Arkansas' GIS data is available and up-to-date. They have made the hurdles to get that data as low as possible and, in so doing, have raised the bar higher when judging data openness and availability.</p>

<p>Put that in your COP and view it.</p>
