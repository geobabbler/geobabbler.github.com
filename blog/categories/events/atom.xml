    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I spent the day yesterday at <a href="http://www.towson.edu/">Towson University</a> attending the <a href="http://www.towson.edu/tugis/">TUGIS 2013</a> conference. The new one-day format was a firehose that showcased the diversity of geospatial work occurring across the State of Maryland. The keynote by <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=44978536">Learon Dalby</a> was well-received and the content of the conference was generally substantive. While the day was a sprint, there was one workshop that really caught my attention more so than I would have thought from its title.</p>

<p>The photo below shows 40 participants of an "Introduction to Free and Open Source GIS Software" workshop getting hands-on experience with <a href="http://www.qgis.org">QGIS</a> and <a href="http://www.postgis.org">PostGIS</a> by working through prepared but realistic scenarios. These scenarios included doing multi-user editing and performing spatial analysis to assess the effects of a potential toxic release over a small town.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"> <img src="http://blog.geomusings.com/images/posts/tugis2013_workshop.jpg" /></p>

<p>The workshop was put together by <a href="http://faculty.salisbury.edu/~ajlembo/">Dr. Arthur Lembo</a> of <a href="http://www.salisbury.edu/">Salisbury University</a> and conducted by him and a team of his students, who not only led portions of the workshop but were also stationed around the room to provide guidance to participants. The scenarios were prepared in printed workbooks that the participants were free to take with them, along with information about how to download the tools. All-in-all, I thought the workshop was very well-designed and presented a thorough overview of the capabilities of these two tools.</p>

<p>To be sure, the workshop was not all unicorns and rainbows. There were typical glitches such as file system and database permission issues that required on-the-fly adjustments, which Dr. Lembo and his students handled well. Some participants were clearly stumped at points while others were making good headway with the examples.</p>

<p>Many of the participants probably remain committed <a href="http://www.esri.com">ArcGIS</a> users after the workshop while others may very well dig in and more thoroughly explore QGIS and PostGIS, but that's really beside the point. Regardless of what the individual participants decide to do with the information from the workshop, all left with hands-on exposure to the tools that was presented in a manner that was free of hyperbole, FUD, or market-speak. They now have more first-hand information with which to make their own educated decisions as to how they want to proceed with their geospatial technology choices; and that, in my opinion, may have been the most valuable outcome of the workshop.</p>

    <link href="http://blog.geomusings.com/2013/03/18/off-to-tugis/"/>
    <updated>2013-03-18T12:40:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.geomusings.com/2013/03/18/off-to-tugis</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Tomorrow, I'll be heading up to the <a href="http://www.towson.edu/tugis/">Towson University GIS (TUGIS) conference</a> with 500 or so of my closest Maryland geo-friends. It has been restructured into a one-day event and the program seems to be very content-rich as a result. I am particularly happy to see more open-source content this year. There's an intro session featuring <a href="http://www.postgresql.org">PostgreSQL</a>, <a href="http://www.postgis.org">PostGIS</a>, <a href="http://qgis.org">QGIS</a>, and <a href="http://geoserver.org">GeoServer</a> presented by <a href="http://www.salisbury.edu/">Salisbury State University</a>. Salisbury was once known as a bastion of <a href="http://www.manifold.net/">Manifold</a> so they've got a long history of thinking outside the Arc. Additionally, there is a session (by Towson University) discussing the use of <a href="http://www.gdal.org">GDAL</a>, <a href="http://www.gdal.org/ogr/">OGR</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/sgillies/shapely">Shapely</a> in the development of a spatial service.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"> <img src="http://blog.geomusings.com/images/mdflag.png" alt="Brian Timoney's favorite state flag" title="Brian Timoney's favorite state flag" /></p>

<p>One thing I like about regional GIS conferences like this is that they tend to focus more on solutions to real-world problems instead of the latest technological bells and whistles. I spend so much of my time with my head in Federal requirements that it's nice do a reset and get different perspectives on how geospatial technologies are used. I am particularly interested to hear the keynote from <a href="http://twitter.com/learondalby">Learon Dalby</a> of <a href="http://www.sanborn.com/">Sanborn</a> and formerly of the <a href="http://www.gis.state.ar.us/">Arkansas GIO office</a>. I had the pleasure of working with Learon and the AGIO team on a project a couple of years ago and am impressed with what they accomplished.</p>

<p>I appreciate the new format of TUGIS as a one-day event is much easier to fit into the schedule. I'm looking forward to it.</p>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[js.geo Day One]]></title>
    <link href="http://blog.geomusings.com/2013/01/14/js-dot-geo-day-one/"/>
    <updated>2013-01-14T18:04:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.geomusings.com/2013/01/14/js-dot-geo-day-one</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday, I attended the <a href="http://geojs.eventbrite.com/">JS.geo</a> conference at the Colorado University Denver campus. It looked like about 100 or so came out for the event. I was able to catch up with <a href="http://twitter.com/cwhelm">Chris Helm</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/briantimoney">Brian Timoney</a> the night before and they told me the event took off faster than they had originally expected. I think this speaks to two things: 1) the level of interest in Javascript as a solution for geospatial applications and 2) the fast pace of innovation in the Javascript community that has a lot of people looking for ways to stay abreast of the latest developments.</p>

<p>What follows is an overview based on some of the notes I took. I wasn't always writing as I sometimes just stopped to listen and I'll probably follow up with more details later.</p>

<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://blog.geomusings.com/images/posts/jsgeo13.png" /></div>


<p>Data reduction was strong current running under the day. With the rise of newer libraries that enable more sophisticated capabilities in the browser, there is increased recognition of the need to reduce the amount of data passing over the wire. For geometry, <a href="https://github.com/mbostock/topojson">TopoJSON</a> is getting a lot of attention here. It delivers topologically correct data which reduces data by removing redundant geometry such coincident arcs between polygons and such. The output reminds me of an old <a href="http://www.gdal.org/ogr/drv_avcbin.html">ARC/INFO coverage</a> and is providing stunning results in reducing the size of geometries when compared to <a href="http://geojson.org">GeoJSON</a> or Esri JSON. <a href="http://twitter.com/andrewxhill">Andrew Hill</a> of <a href="http://vizzuality.com">Vizzuality</a> mentioned that <a href="http://cartodb.com">CartoDB</a> currently has support for TopoJSON in staging. He also discussed strategies they use to reduce the size of feature and attribute data. This "data cubing" strategy turns out to similar to approaches that are commonplace in the financial industry. This serves as a reminder to look around and see what others are doing to solve similar problems.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>One a related note, the reduction of application code being delivered to the browser is also a focus. This was probably best illustrated by <a href="http://twitter.com/mattpriour">Matt Priour's</a> talk on <a href="http://openlayers.org">OpenLayers</a>. The fact that there are now three builds (full, mobile, light) as well as a focus on being more modular in version 3. <a href="http://twitter.com/pmbatty">Peter Batty</a>, in his demo of <a href="http://www.ubisense.net/en/">Ubisense</a>, made a good case for intelligent balance between server-side and client-side processing to achieve good performance.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.khronos.org/webgl/">WebGL</a> got a lot of attention from a number of speakers, with <a href="http://twitter.com/brendankenny">Brendan Kenny</a> of Google showing work he has done, including a Javascript port of GLUTessellation. Jeremy Bartley of Esri gave a lightning talk about <a href="http://www.esri.com/software/cityengine">CityEngine</a>, which is based on WebGL. WebGL is widely seen as the open solution to graphics performance that may finally kill the need for plug-ins. In side discussions, Jeremy talked about how WebGL will figure more into the previously discussed data reduction problem. The reality is that both servers and clients are getting much better at handling large data sets but the same can't necessarily be said for the wires that connect them.</p>

<p>GeoJSON continues to get a lot of love. It continues to be, in my opinion, the motor oil for the engine that is web mapping. It will be interesting see how the separation of concerns between GeoJSON and TopoJSON evolves, but I think GeoJSON will continue to be an important syntax.</p>

<p>While the majority of the discussion focused on browsers, <a href="http://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a> got significant attention. <a href="http://twitter.com/willwhitedc">Will White</a> of <a href="http://mapbox.com">MapBox</a> gave a good talk about the evolution of Node and the advantages of its non-blocking I/O model. One statistic he gave was surprising: he said 6 of the top 12 contributors on GitHub are Node contributors. That speaks loudly to the rapid evolution of Node as well as the interest in Javascript. Will put out a call to the geospatial community to build out the geospatial capabilities of Node. Later in the day, we saw a good lightning talk that showed Node processing real-time data and feeding a number of D3 visualizations.</p>

<p>While Matt Priour and <a href="https://twitter.com/atogle">Aaron Ogle</a> opened with great talks on OpenLayers and <a href="http://leafletjs.com/">Leaflet</a>, respectively, the clear star of the client-side show was <a href="http://d3js.org/">D3</a> (although Aaron's walkshed analysis in Leaflet was cool). There were lots of great visualizations (as well as nods to TopoJSON). While the D3's support for projections is getting a lot of attention from geospatial developers, I am more interested in its holistic approach to data visualization. In D3, geo is one way to look at data, but not the central way. Because of this, D3 provides an integrated capability to have multiple data visualizations in an application without overloading with a ton of libraries.</p>

<p>I am already well past tl;dr on this post and I have to catch a plane. Many of the URL talks were great but I'll follow up with some more details. All-in-all, I think the event was quite a success and I'm glad I came.</p>

    <link href="http://blog.geomusings.com/2013/01/08/getting-ready-for-js-dot-geo/"/>
    <updated>2013-01-08T15:50:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.geomusings.com/2013/01/08/getting-ready-for-js-dot-geo</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I'm looking forward to next week's <a href="http://geojs.eventbrite.com/">JS.geo</a> event in Denver. It is a small event, spearheaded by <a href="http://twitter.com/cwhelm">Chris Helm</a> of <a href="http://www.esri.com">Esri</a>, that focuses on the use of Javascript in geospatial applications. Although I have been more vocal in my <a href="http://blog.geomusings.com/blog/categories/python/">recent explorations with Python</a>, I've probably done as much, if not more, work with Javascript over the past 18 months.</p>

<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://mapbrief.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/no_plugin.jpg" /></div>


<p>The pace of innovation with Javascript in the geospatial area has been staggering. It seems like only a short time ago that the options for working with geospatial applications were <a href="http://openlayers.org/">OpenLayers</a> and the <a href="http://help.arcgis.com/en/webapi/javascript/arcgis/">Esri Javascript API</a>. The rapid advent of tools such as <a href="http://www.geoext.org/">GeoExt</a>, <a href="http://leafletjs.com/">Leaflet</a>, and many others has really lead to a explosion of capability. Of course, the recent buzz has been about <a href="http://d3js.org/">D3</a>, which tackles a wide range of data visualization problems, including geo. D3 is of particular interest because it is tackling the issue of projection in the browser, freeing applications from the dominance of Web Mercator.</p>

<p>Of course, it's not been all about the browser, either as <a href="http://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a> has made abundantly clear. One of the most effective desktop applications for cartographic design, <a href="http://mapbox.com/tilemill/">TileMill</a>, is built with Node, among other tools.</p>

<p>The maturity of Javascript as a tool for geospatial development is such that I am at the point that, if it weren't for government customers that are <a href="http://mapbrief.com/2011/10/13/web-mapping-continues-to-pay-for-the-sins-of-internet-explorer/">still standardized on Internet Explorer 8</a> or older, a plug-in-based environment would not be my first choice for a new application.</p>

<p>As for the JS.geo event itself, I am intrigued by its small, focused nature. It doesn't seem to be as informal as an unconference but may be easier to digest than the typical geo event. It will also be great to catch up with the Front Range crowd.</p>

    <link href="http://blog.geomusings.com/2012/02/03/dcmdva-area-geo-event-scene-getting-more-active/"/>
    <updated>2012-02-03T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.geomusings.com/2012/02/03/dcmdva-area-geo-event-scene-getting-more-active</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There was a time only a few years ago when, if you lived in the DC/MD/VA area, planning your geo-conference schedule for the year went something like this: Register for the ESRI FedUC and then start booking plane tickets for everything else. That is no longer the case with more events occurring in the area. Here's a round-up of a few events that are on my 2012 schedule so far:</p>

<div style="text-align:center;"><img alt="" height="536" src="http://geobabble.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/foss4g_lanyard_small.png" title="foss4g_lanyard_small" width="495" /><div style="text-align:center;font-size: 14px;">You can never have too many of these...<br/><br/></div></div>


<p><a href="http://www.esri.com/events/fedcon/index.html">ESRI Federal GIS Conference</a> (formerly known as the Federal User Conference): 22 - 24 February. This is probably one of the longest-running and largest events in the area. This year features another <a href="http://www.esri.com/events/fedcon/agenda/dev-geo.html">DevGeo</a> session, focusing on developing applications with the various ESRI tools. Last year was the first time it was done at a FedUC and the room was packed all day. This conference is obviously an ESRI show but the last few years have included unofficial, after-hours gatherings of people working with a wide range of geospatial tools. Even if you are not an ESRI user, there may be something going on in the vicinity that would be worthwhile. <!--more--></p>

<p><a href="http://www.towson.edu/tugis/">TUGIS 2012</a>: 19 - 20 March. I hesitated to list this because the last thing you want to do is suggest to someone from Baltimore that they are in the DC area. So let me clarify: This is NOT technically a DC-area event but it draws a lot of attendees from the DC area. It's also probably the longest running GIS-related event in the region, celebrating its 25th year this year. The organizers at Towson do a good job of mixing up the program so it's not as overtly "Federal" as events farther down I-95 can be.</p>

<p><a href="http://foss4g-na.org/">FOSS4G North America</a>: 10 - 12 April. This event was the topic of my <a href="http://blog.geomusings.com/2012/01/23/foss4g-north-america-to-be-held-in-washington-dc/">previous post</a>. Clearly, it's intended to be a North American event and I would expect it to move around year-to-year so I'll just be happy for the good fortune that <a href="http://www.osgeo.org/">OSGEO</a> decided to inaugurate it in my back yard. It makes perfect sense as there is growing interest in, and adoption of, open-source geospatial tools in the Federal Government.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.wherecampdc.org/">WhereCampDC 2012</a>: Dates TBD. <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/kelsosCorner/status/156469857704083457">I have heard rumblings</a> but haven't seen details. Last year's event was great and I hope it is reprised this year.</p>

<p>There are also a couple of interesting recurring events that have taken root in the area:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.meetup.com/Geo-DC/">Geo DC Meetups</a> - This is an independent group that meets the first Wednesday of every month and covers a wide range of topics. Given that I live out in the provinces, I don't get into the city as much as I would like for these but the group has been gaining momentum. It seems to be doing a good job of building a community of geo-minded people in the area.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.meetup.com/DevMeetUpNortheast/">ESRI Dev Meetups</a>: These meetups are ostensibly focused on application development with ESRI tools but, in practice, the content of the talks cover a wide variety of issues and tools. There have been talks regarding integration of ESRI tools with other geospatial platforms, best practices, case studies, etc. The nice part about these events is that ESRI doesn't want their staff doing the talking. They just book the venue and put out the refreshments. These meetups occur as part of ESRI's Northeast regional effort to establish these events so they don't occur as frequently as the Geo DC events.</p>

<p>This level of activity in the region is good to see as the potential for a vibrant community has always been there. There are lots of people involved in making this happen but the people at <a href="http://developmentseed.org/">Development Seed</a>, <a href="http://www.geoiq.com">GeoIQ</a> and <a href="http://www.esri.com">ESRI</a> have been particularly proactive in energizing their respective constituencies and the results seem to be beneficial for all.</p>
