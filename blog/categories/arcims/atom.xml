    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It's been an extremely busy few months, as evidenced by the pace (or lack thereof) of blogging. I have been hopping between customer sites, mainly helping with ArcGIS Server implementations. We're also re-hosting an ArcIMS site for someone. I expect that to eventually transition as well but we have to get it moved first. I'm also working a pro-bono implementation of PostGIS/GeoServer/OpenLayers for the town of Green Mountain Falls, Colorado. That's been fun. It's great to see how a small town can marshall it resources (Boys Scouts with GPS collected trails as an Eagle Scout project) to get things done. The initial implementation will be simple as they are more interested in getting their data out there but then we'll circle back around to address public-service-type applications after that.</p>

<p>Significant changes are coming for <a href="http://pub.obtusesoft.com">zigGIS</a>. Abe, Paolo and I have been laying out a roadmap for its way ahead. Look for an announcement soon via <a href="http://twitter.com/zigGIS">zigGIS on Twitter</a>.</p>

<p>I have been having a lot of fun with the REST-based APIs from ESRI (Javascript, Flex, Silverlight/WPF). In particular, I've been happy with how extensible they are in terms of being able to support new data sources.
<a href="http://openlayers.org/pipermail/users/2009-June/012414.html">OpenLayers 2.8</a> and <a href="http://blog.opengeo.org/2009/06/17/geoexplorer-preview/">GeoExplorer</a> are also on my radar but that radar screen is getting pretty crowded.</p>

<p>All of this with less than a week to go before vacation. Whew!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I just wrapped up the second phase of the first significant Java project I've done in a long time. In general, I try to be technology-agnostic but, due mainly to customer demand, I find myself working predominantly in .Net. As a result, I find myself treading water a little bit when I have to work with Java.</p>

<p><img alt="" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-203" height="300" src="http://geobabble.files.wordpress.com/2008/07/java.png?w=295" width="295" /></p>

<p>I did this last project in NetBeans 6.1 and was generally pleased with it. I was originally an Eclipse fan but have been less and less happy with it with each release. But my real problem is that I need to get more comfortable with the workflow when working with Java and Java tools. This last round of coding was a little more "cowboy" than I am typcially comfortable with.</p>

<p>This time around, I was working with ArcIMS (ugh), JSP and a couple of custom servlets. I found NetBeans integration of Tomcat to be pretty seamless, yielding a test/debug experience similar to that you get when developing ASP.NET in VS2005 and VS2008. I see hooks to integrate with SCC systems such as CVS and SVN. We're currently using VSS (again, mostly .Net work) but I've been meaning to set up an SVN server. This may give me the little extra push I needed.</p>
