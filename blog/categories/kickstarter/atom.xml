    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://twitter.com/wonderchook">Kate Chapman</a> of <a href="http://hot.openstreetmap.org/">HOT OSM</a> has started a project over on <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/wonderchook/first-free-haiti-creole-openstreetmap-book">Kickstarter</a> to fund the development of a <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/wonderchook/first-free-haiti-creole-openstreetmap-book">Haitian Creole OpenStreetMap</a> book. She sums it up much better than I can over on the project page:</p>

<blockquote>In 2011 the first free OpenStreetMap book was written with support from the Google Open-Source Office using the Floss Manuals book writing technique. This book is currently available in French and English. There are two official languages of Haiti are French and Haitian Creole. French is the language of government and Haitian Creole is the language of the people. By not having instructions on how to get started in OpenStreetMap available for everyone the growth of this free map is slowed.</blockquote>


<p>The goal is to raise $2,000.00 by May 30th. The role OpenStreetMap played in the aftermath of the earthquake in Haiti is pretty well-documented. So <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/wonderchook/first-free-haiti-creole-openstreetmap-book">get on over</a> to Kickstarter and help keep the success going.</p>
