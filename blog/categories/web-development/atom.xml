    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So I've been playing with <a href="http://leaflet.cloudmade.com/" target="_blank">Leaflet</a> a lot lately. It's become my lightweight mapping library of choice. There's a lot it doesn't do so I keep <a href="http://www.openlayers.org/" target="_blank">OpenLayers</a> and others in the rotation as well but Leaflet is direct and to the point so I use it when I can.</p>

<div style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://demo.zekiah.com/clustermap/"><img alt="" class="size-full wp-image-2848" height="291" src="http://geobabble.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/gisp_cluster.png" title="Cluster Map of US GISPs" width="640" /></a><div style="text-align:center;font-size: 14px;">Click the image to go to the live demo<br/><br/></div></div>


<p>A while back, I stumbled onto the <a href="https://github.com/danzel/Leaflet.markercluster" target="_blank">Leaflet.markercluster</a> project on GitHub, which adds a clustering layer type. I wanted to try it so I revisited my old <a href="http://blog.geomusings.com/2011/02/02/mapping-gisp-and-pmp-certifications-with-geocommons-and-the-esri-silverlight-api/" target="_blank">GISP heat map demo</a> (Silverlight) and decided to rework it. I was happy to finally get a chance to strip out the plug-in, anyway.  <!--more--></p>

<p>This time around, I chose not to bother with the PMP data because it was kind of a pain to process the last time. I downloaded the GISP data from the <a href="http://www.gisci.org/secure/members/directory/results.asp" target="_blank">GISCI site</a> and once again ran it through <a href="http://www.geocommons.com" target="_blank">GeoCommons</a> to geocode it. This time, there were noticeable anomalies, such as positional accuracy problems (Richmond, VA was 25 miles east of where it should have been) and surprising omissions such as a failure to match major cities like Jacksonville, Florida and Phoenix, Arizona. I corrected some of the more egregious problems by hand and dumped the rest. Luckily none of this got in the way of the real goal of testing the clustering library but, if you visit the <a href="http://demo.zekiah.com/clustermap" target="_blank">live demo</a>, any anomalies you may notice are most likely related to the data and not the library.</p>

<p>Once geocoding was complete, I downloaded the CSV and processed it into the JSON structure expected by the marker cluster library. The library is still fairly new, and I am fairly new to using it so I had some problems if I deviated from the sample format. As a result, I stuck to that format and resolved to investigate it more. After that, it was very easy to wire up into a light application, with the clusters thrown on top of some tiles from <a href="http://www.mapbox.com" target="_blank">MapBox</a>. (Thanks to <a href="http://www.geosprocket.com/" target="_blank">Bill Morris</a> for showing me that base map.)</p>

<p>I think I prefer this representation to a heat map as it conveys more information at a glance. I'm happy to have this library in my toolbox now and am looking forward to seeing it evolve. I recommend checking it out.</p>

    <link href="http://blog.geomusings.com/2012/07/09/cartodbleaflet-sample-update/"/>
    <updated>2012-07-09T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.geomusings.com/2012/07/09/cartodbleaflet-sample-update</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A while back, I posted about some experimentation I did with <a href="http://leaflet.cloudmade.com/" target="_blank">Leaflet</a> and <a href="http://cartodb.com/" target="_blank">CartoDB</a> in the wake of FOSS4G in Denver. I recently had the chance to go back and update that sample with some spatial queries. At the time of the original post, CartoDB was still in beta and spatial queries didn't seem to work, despite the fact that the back-end was driven by PostGIS.</p>

<p><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2737" height="310" src="http://geobabble.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/cartodb_spatial_query.png" title="cartodb_spatial_query" width="640" /></p>

<!--more-->


<p>Since then, of course, CartoDB has gone production, as has <a href="http://www.postgis.org" target="_blank">PostGIS</a> 2.0 (up to <a href="http://www.postgis.org/news/20120622/" target="_blank">2.0.1</a> now) so I decided to <a href="http://demo.zekiah.com/propfinder2/" target="_blank">update the sample</a> a little. This time, I added a floodway layer that flows through <a href="http://leonardtown.somd.com/" target="_blank" title="Official Leonardtown home page">Leonardtown</a>, <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?sugexp=chrome,mod%3D16&amp;q=leonardtown,+md&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=0x89b768aa0432337d:0x22590e342c11b91b,Leonardtown,+MD&amp;gl=us&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=wRL8T9TIFqno0QGshqC6Bg&amp;ved=0CHwQtgM" target="_blank" title="Leonardtown in Google Maps">Maryland</a>. With a button click, you can identify the buildings that intersect the floodway. I am again using the CartoDB SQL API and GeoJSON to accomplish this. The API call that accomplishes this is:</p>

<p><a href="http://geomusings.cartodb.com/api/v2/sql?q=SELECT%20leonardtown_bldgs.*%20FROM%20leonardtown_bldgs,floodway%20WHERE%20ST_Intersects(floodway.the_geom,leonardtown_bldgs.the_geom)&amp;format=geojson" target="_blank">http://geomusings.cartodb.com/api/v2/sql?q=SELECT%20leonardtown_bldgs.*%20FROM%20leonardtown_bldgs,<br />floodway%20WHERE%20ST_Intersects(floodway.the_geom,leonardtown_bldgs.the_geom)<br />&amp;format=geojson</a></p>

<p>If you pull that apart, you'll see a relatively straightforward use of a PostGIS spatial operator in there:</p>

<p>The CartoDB documentation has greatly improved since my last post, including some <a href="http://developers.cartodb.com/examples.html" target="_blank">good developer examples</a>. A little bit of comfort with PostGIS-esque spatial SQL goes a long way with CartoDB. It's good to see how the platform is evolving.</p>

    <updated>2011-10-13T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.geomusings.com/2011/10/13/cartodb-leaflet-easy</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One of the biggest sources of buzz at <a href="http://2011.foss4g.org/">FOSS4G</a> was <a href="http://cartodb.com">CartoDB</a>. It is a hosted solution from <a href="http://vizzuality.com/">Vizzuality</a> that uses <a href="http://postgis.org/">PostGIS</a> to allow you to store your spatial data online. I got a beta account a couple of weeks ago but life (i.e. paying work) kept getting in the way but I finally got to play with it recently.</p>

<p>One of the things that intrigued me is that, similar to <a href="http://www.google.com/fusiontables/Home/">Google Fusion Tables</a>, CartoDB exposes a SQL interface through a RESTful API (I'm still not sure if the term "API" applies to REST but it's a convenient shorthand). Essentially, CartoDB exposes PostgreSQL SQL and the spatial SQL extensions of PostGIS. Once your data is loaded, you can query it and return the results as either CartoDB's JSON syntax, KML or <a href="http://geojson.org">GeoJSON</a>.</p>

<p>With this information, I set out to build a simple application to query property data and display the results on a map in a browser. In addition to CartoDB, I elected to use the <a href="http://leaflet.cloudmade.com/">Leaflet</a> Javascript library to accomplish the mapping (although I also experimented with OpenLayers). Displaying and styling GeoJSON in Leaflet is very straightforward and this task gave me and excuse to get a little more comfortable with it.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>For starters, I downloaded building footprints for St. Mary's County, Maryland (freely available <a href="http://www.stmarysmd.com/gis/">here</a>). The footprints themselves are countywide so I also downloaded the boundary for Leonardtown, Maryland and used <a href="http://qgis.org/">QGIS</a> to clip out just those buildings that fell within the town boundary. Once my data was prepped, I uploaded it into CartoDB.</p>

<div style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" class="size-full wp-image-2134" height="359" src="http://geobabble.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/cartodb_upload.png" title="cartodb_upload" width="590" /><div style="text-align: center; font-size: 14px">The CartoDB uploader is very easy to use.<br /></div></div>


<p>Once the data is uploaded and made public, it is as easy as a URL to pull down the GeoJSON (or even KML). Click here:</p>

<p><a href="http://geomusings.cartodb.com/api/v1/sql?q=SELECT%20*%20FROM%20leonardtown_bldgs&amp;format=geojson">http://geomusings.cartodb.com/api/v1/sql?q=SELECT%20*%20FROM%20leonardtown_bldgs&amp;format=geojson</a></p>

<p>You'll notice that some SQL is embedded in the URL. Finding the commercial properties in the data set is as simple as adding a WHERE clause:</p>

<p><a href="http://geomusings.cartodb.com/api/v1/sql?q=SELECT%20*%20FROM%20leonardtown_bldgs%20WHERE%20structure_%20=%20'Commercial'&amp;format=geojson">http://geomusings.cartodb.com/api/v1/sql?q=SELECT%20*%20FROM%20leonardtown_bldgs%20WHERE%20structure_%20=%20'Commercial'&amp;format=geojson</a></p>

<p>This became the basis of my sample application. I decided to do a simple property finder that allows a user to find buildings by property type and square footage. As I mentioned, it's very easy to use GeoJSON with Leaflet. Here is the Javascript function that fetches the buildings from CartoDB and adds them to the map. It uses jQuery to do the actual fetch and then processes the result, adding the features into a Leaflet GeoJSON layer.</p>

<p><del datetime="2011-10-14T14:44:58+00:00">If you look closely, you'll notice the use of a proxy handler to get past the same origin restriction. This handler is written in .Net. I had been using a Python proxy but urllib2 was indicating header errors in the return from CartoDB so I fell back to this one. I'll dig into that more later.</del> (Thanks to <a href="http://twitter.com/jatorre">Javier de la Torre</a> for straightening me out with the use of a callback.) The above routine is basically the template for all the work in the app. Aside from the basemap tiles, the app loads the town boundary and the buildings from CartoDB. A similar funtion drives the query function, building and passing a WHERE clause to CartoDB. The image below shows the interface with query results in blue. The popups are performed by Leaflet.</p>

<div style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" class="size-full wp-image-2139" height="300" src="http://geobabble.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/propfinder.png" title="propfinder" width="590" /><div style="text-align: center; font-size: 14px">Selected buildings are shown in blue with popups to display the property details<br /></div></div>


<p>All told, this app took about 3 or so hours to build and deploy. This version doesn't actually make use of any spatial SQL yet but I'll add that soon. The live demo can be found here: <a href="http://demo.zekiah.com/propfinder/">http://demo.zekiah.com/propfinder/</a> (give the buildings a few seconds to load). It seems to work well in Firefox and Chrome and is functional, although clunky, in IE9. I haven't tried Safari or earlier versions of IE.</p>

<p>CartoDB is still in beta but already seems solid and is definitely powerful. As a hosted solution, there are associated costs but that's to be expected. I'll keep playing with it but it's already impressive.</p>

    <id>http://blog.geomusings.com/2011/02/02/mapping-gisp-and-pmp-certifications-with-geocommons-and-the-esri-silverlight-api</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Note: The application described in this post is running <a href="http://demo.zekiah.com/heatmap">here</a>. It requires Silverlight 4.</p>

<p>I was perusing my <a href="http://www.linkedin.com">LinkedIn</a> connections and noticed that quite a few had <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Management_Professional">PMP</a> certifications. I also noticed that most of those who did seemed to be in the Washington, DC area. Of course, given that I live in that region, my sample could be a bit skewed but then I started <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/billdollins/status/30277725008699392">thinking out loud</a> (via Twitter):</p>

<blockquote>I would love to see a heat map showing concentrations of PMPs. I bet the DC area would be white-hot. I suspect others not so much.</blockquote>


<p>Naturally, I could not let this sit. How hard could it be? It turns out it wasn't that hard so I decided to throw a small app together to look at the data. In the process of working out an approach, I decided to also look at <a href="http://www.gisci.org/certification_program_description.aspx">GISP</a> certifications because the data set is smaller and is available as one download from the <a href="http://www.gisci.org/">GISCI</a>. Here's a blow-by-blow:</p>

<!--more-->


<p><strong>Preparing the data</strong></p>

<p>Both the GISCI and <a href="http://www.pmi.org">PMI</a> maintain registries of current certification holders. In the case of the GISCI, the registry is available as a single download, if needed, so I grabbed the current list of certified GISPs (as of January 26, 2011). I only cared about location and date (which I'll make use of in the future) so I stripped out all of the names. Then I deleted all of the non-US records (to keep my geocoding easy). That left me with city, state and date. To geocode the data, I uploaded it to <a href="http://www.geocommons.com">GeoCommons</a>. I have <a href="http://geobabble.wordpress.com/2010/10/06/geocoding-with-geocommons/">blogged about this capability previously</a> but this was a larger data set (and only required matching cities). The processing took about 20 seconds and only missed about 75 records out of about about 4500 records. The majority of the missed locations were APO/FPO addresses so I just removed those records. Once that was done, I left the data up on GeoCommons where <a href="http://geocommons.com/overlays/87503">it's still available</a>.</p>

<p>For the PMP data the basic process was the same but getting the data was a little trickier. The PMI doesn't offer a single download so I had to use their query tool to query US records my the first letter of the last name. The query tool returns a maximum of 1000 records so I ended up with about 24,000 records ("Q", "X" and "Z" don't have 1000 records). I pieced this together in Excel, stripped out the names and ended up with the same information I had for the GISP data. In this case, the data set is not complete but I felt like it probably was still representative of the geographic dispersion of certification holders so I went forward.</p>

<p>The PMP data set was too large to upload and geocode on GeoCommons (which caps geocoding at 5000 records). Fortunately, Kate and <a href="http://www.fortiusone.com">FortiusOne</a> was gracious enough to geocode it for me (I wanted to use the same geocoder for both data sets). After a little cleanup, <a href="http://geocommons.com/overlays/87707">I posted that one to GeoCommons as well</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Mapping the data</strong></p>

<p>I wanted to use a heat map to show the data (for no particular reason). There are numerous ways to accomplish this but I chose to use the <a href="http://help.arcgis.com/en/webapi/silverlight/index.html">ESRI ArcGIS API for Silverlight</a>. I made this choice primarily because a lot of my project work right now involves it so the tools are at my fingertips. Also, it has a HeatMapLayer class which I had not had a chance to try yet.</p>

<p>So I set up a simple mapping application and, at runtime, I load the data from GeoCommons and populate each heat map layer with the points from the appropriate data set. In this case I loaded the data as CSV (which is one of the data options on GeoCommons) by making the appropriate call to the GeoCommons API. I chose CSV because I only needed the latitude and longitude of each location and CSV was actually the least wordy transmission mode. I parsed the data using the <a href="http://kbcsv.codeplex.com/">KBCsv</a> parser available on CodePlex. I could have also loaded the data as GeoJSON and used <a href="http://json.codeplex.com/">JSON.Net</a> or Vish's outstanding <a href="http://viswaug.wordpress.com/2008/05/11/geojsonnet-a-net-library-to-produce-geojson-output/">GeoJSON.Net</a> library but CSV suited my needs in this case. Here is a screen shot showing the GISP data.</p>

<p><a href="http://geobabble.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/gisp_heatmap1.png"><img alt="" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1484" height="242" src="http://geobabble.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/gisp_heatmap1.png" title="GISP Heat Map" width="590" /></a></p>

<p><strong>Reading the data</strong></p>

<p>So, did the data confirm the suspicion from my original tweet? Yes. The ESRI API calculates heat map intensity based upon the data that is visible in the current map extent. When you zoom out to the whole nation, you can clearly see that the highest concentration of both certifications, by far, is in the Washington, DC area. If you zoom in more and pan around, the mapping adjusts itself so you can get a better representation of other areas by zooming in to them (and away from DC). You can also adjust the display with the intensity tool to bring out some local variations.</p>

<p>What doesn't come across well is relative scale. There are a lot more PMPs than GISPs but that doesn't show well in this presentation. That's why I chose to put a toggle on the map because there's very little value in seeing the two data sets overlaid.</p>

<p>All told, it took about two hours to get the core of the application in place and maybe about another hour to tidy things up. With GeoCommons, it literally took longer to prep the data than to geocode it and the native heat mapping capability of the ESRI Silverlight API was extremely easy to use. The Silverlight implementation shuts out most mobile users and anyone on Linux (Moonlight is not yet Silverlight 4 compatible) so, for those reasons, I'll continue to explore more standards-based approaches but this combination of tools certainly helped me answer my question quickly.</p>
