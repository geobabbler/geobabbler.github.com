    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I've had a couple of people ask me recently about the geospatial tools I use. Year-over-year, that answer changes but here's how I answer that right now:</p>

<p>As a Federal contractor, I spend a lot of time working with the <a href="http://www.esri.com" target="_blank">Esri</a> stack during my work day. A few years ago, I added a few open-source geospatial tools into my tool set and, since then, have also done a respectable amount to consulting work them as well. The balance between the two varies over time, depending on the requirements of individual customers and projects. Lately, commercial customers have seemed much more interested in open-source tools while my government customers are sticking with Esri. Since those observations are based on the the extremely heavy filter of my own recent experience, I'd be hesitant to draw any larger conclusions from them.</p>

<p><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2958" height="264" src="http://geobabble.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/duct-tape.jpg" title="Duct Tape" width="300" /></p>

<p>I've always believed that proficiency with a wide range of tools makes me a better consultant and integrator, so I am always exploring and trying new things. With those commercial customers, and in my own personal side projects, my recent workflows have gelled around a core set of tools, both commercial and open-source: <!--more--></p>

<p><a href="http://www.postgis.org" target="_blank">PostGIS</a> - I am very comfortable with SQL and tend to use <a href="http://www.postgresql.org" target="_blank">PostgreSQL</a> and PostGIS for a lot of my vector data processing. Lately, this has mainly involved joining up geometries with attributes and doing aggregations and similar things. For example, the vector data in this <a href="http://geobabbler.github.com/mdq62012.html" target="_blank">map of the county-level Maryland Question 6 results</a> was processed in PostGIS. Very simply, I have a baseline table of the counties of Maryland which I will use to create new data sets. In this case, I imported a CSV of the election results, created a view that joined up the data and then selected the view into a new table. This is workflow is much easier with PostGIS 2.x thanks to the <a href="http://blog.opengeo.org/2012/03/06/postgis-2-0-new-features-typmod/" target="_blank">use of typmod</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://qgis.org" target="_blank">QGIS</a> - In the case of the map mentioned above, the data set is ultimately going to be static so it makes sense to serve it as static content, rather than bringing a heavyweight geospatial server such as <a href="http://www.esri.com/software/arcgis/arcgisserver/" target="_blank">ArcGIS</a> or <a href="http://geoserver.org/display/GEOS/Welcome" target="_blank">GeoServer</a> into the mix. In these cases, I lean toward <a href="http://geojson.org/" target="_blank">GeoJSON</a>. QGIS makes it very easy to export any vector layer out to GeoJSON so it's become my go-to tool for that. QGIS also has great analytical tools and I consider it a complete functional match for ArcMap but, having said that, I'm actually very comfortable with the spatial SQL functions in PostGIS so I end up doing most of my analytical work there.</p>

<p><a href="http://leafletjs.com/" target="_blank">Leaflet</a>/<a href="http://www.openlayers.org/" target="_blank">OpenLayers</a> - Most of the web maps I'm doing are single-use and pretty straightforward. When that's the case, I prefer to use Leaflet as it's a pretty lightweight library. That said, I keep OpenLayers in the mix if the GIS-like requirements get a little more complex. OpenLayers does more "out of the box" than Leaflet but Leaflet is trimmer so it really depends on the use case.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.arc2earth.com/" target="_blank">Arc2Earth</a>/<a href="http://mapbox.com/tilemill/" target="_blank">TileMill </a>- Arc2Earth is a commercial extension to ArcGIS and I lean on it to make tiles, although it does a lot more than that. I also use TileMill for this purpose but it really depends on where my cartography resides. There's a lot of good cartography locked up in MXDs and Arc2Earth is just a great way to capitalize on that. It's also nice that Arc2Earth works in ArcMap, eliminating the need for a license of Server.  If I'm building my cartography from scratch, which is not really my strong suit, I'll lean toward TileMill because it more easily connects directly to PostGIS, which is where my data tends to reside if I have my druthers. Again, it depends on the use case.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.python.org/" target="_blank">Python</a>/Javascript - I'm doing a lot more work in Python these days. It's become the <em>lingua franca</em> of GIS development in my book. Additionally, the capabilities of Javascript for web maps is evolving at a stunning pace. I can't see being productive in the long term in the geospatial field without proficiency in these two languages.</p>

<p>So these are the tools that I'm using most often these days as part of my personal workflows. The stable of tools that I use evolves over time, as should be evident if you peruse this blog. In general, I'm finding it very easy to be productive with these tools right now.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So I've been playing with <a href="http://leaflet.cloudmade.com/" target="_blank">Leaflet</a> a lot lately. It's become my lightweight mapping library of choice. There's a lot it doesn't do so I keep <a href="http://www.openlayers.org/" target="_blank">OpenLayers</a> and others in the rotation as well but Leaflet is direct and to the point so I use it when I can.</p>

<p>[caption id="attachment_2848" align="aligncenter" width="640"]<a href="http://demo.zekiah.com/clustermap/"><img alt="" class="size-full wp-image-2848" height="291" src="http://geobabble.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/gisp_cluster.png" title="Cluster Map of US GISPs" width="640" /></a> Click the image to go to the live demo[/caption]</p>

<p>A while back, I stumbled onto the <a href="https://github.com/danzel/Leaflet.markercluster" target="_blank">Leaflet.markercluster</a> project on GitHub, which adds a clustering layer type. I wanted to try it so I revisited my old <a href="http://blog.geomusings.com/2011/02/02/mapping-gisp-and-pmp-certifications-with-geocommons-and-the-esri-silverlight-api/" target="_blank">GISP heat map demo</a> (Silverlight) and decided to rework it. I was happy to finally get a chance to strip out the plug-in, anyway.  <!--more--></p>

<p>This time around, I chose not to bother with the PMP data because it was kind of a pain to process the last time. I downloaded the GISP data from the <a href="http://www.gisci.org/secure/members/directory/results.asp" target="_blank">GISCI site</a> and once again ran it through <a href="http://www.geocommons.com" target="_blank">GeoCommons</a> to geocode it. This time, there were noticeable anomalies, such as positional accuracy problems (Richmond, VA was 25 miles east of where it should have been) and surprising omissions such as a failure to match major cities like Jacksonville, Florida and Phoenix, Arizona. I corrected some of the more egregious problems by hand and dumped the rest. Luckily none of this got in the way of the real goal of testing the clustering library but, if you visit the <a href="http://demo.zekiah.com/clustermap" target="_blank">live demo</a>, any anomalies you may notice are most likely related to the data and not the library.</p>

<p>Once geocoding was complete, I downloaded the CSV and processed it into the JSON structure expected by the marker cluster library. The library is still fairly new, and I am fairly new to using it so I had some problems if I deviated from the sample format. As a result, I stuck to that format and resolved to investigate it more. After that, it was very easy to wire up into a light application, with the clusters thrown on top of some tiles from <a href="http://www.mapbox.com" target="_blank">MapBox</a>. (Thanks to <a href="http://www.geosprocket.com/" target="_blank">Bill Morris</a> for showing me that base map.)</p>

<p>I think I prefer this representation to a heat map as it conveys more information at a glance. I'm happy to have this library in my toolbox now and am looking forward to seeing it evolve. I recommend checking it out.</p>
