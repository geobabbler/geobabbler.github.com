    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There was a time only a few years ago when, if you lived in the DC/MD/VA area, planning your geo-conference schedule for the year went something like this: Register for the ESRI FedUC and then start booking plane tickets for everything else. That is no longer the case with more events occurring in the area. Here's a round-up of a few events that are on my 2012 schedule so far:</p>

<div style="text-align:center;"><img alt="" height="536" src="http://geobabble.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/foss4g_lanyard_small.png" title="foss4g_lanyard_small" width="495" /><div style="text-align:center;font-size: 14px;">You can never have too many of these...<br/><br/></div></div>


<p><a href="http://www.esri.com/events/fedcon/index.html">ESRI Federal GIS Conference</a> (formerly known as the Federal User Conference): 22 - 24 February. This is probably one of the longest-running and largest events in the area. This year features another <a href="http://www.esri.com/events/fedcon/agenda/dev-geo.html">DevGeo</a> session, focusing on developing applications with the various ESRI tools. Last year was the first time it was done at a FedUC and the room was packed all day. This conference is obviously an ESRI show but the last few years have included unofficial, after-hours gatherings of people working with a wide range of geospatial tools. Even if you are not an ESRI user, there may be something going on in the vicinity that would be worthwhile. <!--more--></p>

<p><a href="http://www.towson.edu/tugis/">TUGIS 2012</a>: 19 - 20 March. I hesitated to list this because the last thing you want to do is suggest to someone from Baltimore that they are in the DC area. So let me clarify: This is NOT technically a DC-area event but it draws a lot of attendees from the DC area. It's also probably the longest running GIS-related event in the region, celebrating its 25th year this year. The organizers at Towson do a good job of mixing up the program so it's not as overtly "Federal" as events farther down I-95 can be.</p>

<p><a href="http://foss4g-na.org/">FOSS4G North America</a>: 10 - 12 April. This event was the topic of my <a href="http://blog.geomusings.com/2012/01/23/foss4g-north-america-to-be-held-in-washington-dc/">previous post</a>. Clearly, it's intended to be a North American event and I would expect it to move around year-to-year so I'll just be happy for the good fortune that <a href="http://www.osgeo.org/">OSGEO</a> decided to inaugurate it in my back yard. It makes perfect sense as there is growing interest in, and adoption of, open-source geospatial tools in the Federal Government.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.wherecampdc.org/">WhereCampDC 2012</a>: Dates TBD. <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/kelsosCorner/status/156469857704083457">I have heard rumblings</a> but haven't seen details. Last year's event was great and I hope it is reprised this year.</p>

<p>There are also a couple of interesting recurring events that have taken root in the area:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.meetup.com/Geo-DC/">Geo DC Meetups</a> - This is an independent group that meets the first Wednesday of every month and covers a wide range of topics. Given that I live out in the provinces, I don't get into the city as much as I would like for these but the group has been gaining momentum. It seems to be doing a good job of building a community of geo-minded people in the area.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.meetup.com/DevMeetUpNortheast/">ESRI Dev Meetups</a>: These meetups are ostensibly focused on application development with ESRI tools but, in practice, the content of the talks cover a wide variety of issues and tools. There have been talks regarding integration of ESRI tools with other geospatial platforms, best practices, case studies, etc. The nice part about these events is that ESRI doesn't want their staff doing the talking. They just book the venue and put out the refreshments. These meetups occur as part of ESRI's Northeast regional effort to establish these events so they don't occur as frequently as the Geo DC events.</p>

<p>This level of activity in the region is good to see as the potential for a vibrant community has always been there. There are lots of people involved in making this happen but the people at <a href="http://developmentseed.org/">Development Seed</a>, <a href="http://www.geoiq.com">GeoIQ</a> and <a href="http://www.esri.com">ESRI</a> have been particularly proactive in energizing their respective constituencies and the results seem to be beneficial for all.</p>

    <link href="http://blog.geomusings.com/2010/12/13/devgeo-session-at-the-esri-feduc/"/>
    <updated>2010-12-13T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.geomusings.com/2010/12/13/devgeo-session-at-the-esri-feduc</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We are approximately a month away from the <a href="http://www.esri.com/events/feduc/index.html">Esri Federal User Conference</a>. It is probably the largest geospatially-themed event in the DC/Maryland/Virginia area each year and has gotten bigger each year. I have documented this conference in the past and have pointed out that, despite its name, there is a lot of information that can be of value for state/local and other non-Federal users of Esri products. Given constrained travel budgets, it?s a good option for people who may not be able to make it to San Diego.</p>

<p>This year, Esri has added something new to the FedUC. It was somewhat innocuously <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/JimBarry/status/13301630267039745">tweeted by Jim Barry</a> last week but is, in my opinion, a significant addition. If you check the agenda, you will now see that Thursday, January 20 now includes an <a href="http://www.esri.com/events/feduc/agenda/dev-geo.html">all-day DevGeo session</a>. This is a follow-on event to the <a href="http://www.esri.com/events/devgeo/index.html">inaugural DevGeo session</a> put on in Silicon Valley in November.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>Esri has stepped up its direct engagement with developers recently, most notably through the excellent <a href="http://www.esri.com/events/dev-meetup/index.html">Dev Meetup series</a>. Those sessions have been driven primarily by users and, as a result, have had a surprisingly wide range of topics (Windows authentication and PostgreSQL in Illinois, <a href="http://geocommons.com">GeoCommons</a> integration in DC, etc.). The nature of development on the Esri platform is changing rapidly. Gone are the days when ArcObjects was the bread-and-butter of Esri development. I have done a lot of ArcObjects development (and am still doing some) but it is now possible to develop robust applications on the Esri platform without ever writing a line of ArcObjects code. The change has been more gradual than the shift from AML and Avenue to ArcObjects was but is no less significant.</p>

<p>As a result, events like DevGeo are important for staying current on the latest APIs and tools for the Esri platform. The addition of this event to the FedUC provides an opportunity for developers in the region to jump start their familiarity with these tools. It extends the value of the FedUC and was a good move by Esri to add it to the agenda.</p>
