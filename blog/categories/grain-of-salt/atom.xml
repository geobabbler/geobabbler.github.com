    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A year ago, I used the StackExchange API to facilitate an <a href="http://blog.geomusings.com/2012/09/13/carving-up-gis-stackexchange/">analysis of tags on GIS StackExchange</a> to see what people were talking about on one of the largest and most successful vendor-neutral discussion sites in our industry. In that post, I stated "It would probably be good to revisit this in a year to see how things have changed, if at all."</p>

<p>Well, a year has passed so I decided to do it again. I used the same scripts and approach I used last time in order to be consistent. Since this is one year later, there is one key caveat. My analysis last year looked at the top 100 tags since the start of the <a href="http://gis.stackexchange.com/">GIS StackExchange</a> site. Since I ran the same query this year, the new results are compounded so what they so are last year's results plus activity since then. Essentially, you are looking at "that plus this." The pie chart below shows the breakdown.</p>

<p>Compared to last year's results, there hasn't been much movement in the distribution of tags. One thing I did notice, however is that the tag "qgis" leaped to the top of the list. Last year, "arcgis" was the top tag and "qgis" was number three. That said, I wouldn't jump to too many conclusions. A quick <a href="/assets/data/stack2013/output_2013.csv">look at the data</a> shows that, in addition to "arcgis", there are version-specific tags such as "arcgis-10.0" and "arcgis-10.1" as well as product-specific tags like "arcgis-server" so there's a lot of Esri-centric discussion going on, but that is to be expected. The top ten tags, however, include major components of the <a href="http://opengeo.org/">OpenGeo</a> Suite (OpenLayers, GeoServer, PostGIS) in addition to QGIS so open-source tools seem to be every bit as active a topic of discussion as do <a href="http://www.esri.com">Esri</a> tools.</p>

<p>Speaking of the top ten tags, they were: <br /><br />
1. qgis (3910) <br />
2. arcgis (2382) <br />
3. python (2171) <br />
4. arcgis-10.0 (2142) <br />
5. openlayers (1996) <br />
6. postgis (1560) <br />
7. geoserver (1193) <br />
8. arcobjects (1184) <br />
9. raster (1174) <br />
10. arcmap (1113) <br /></p>

<p>Last year, I got some back-channel requests to do a little more with the raw data so, seeing a chance to play with <a href="http://d3js.org">D3</a>, here is a look at how things break down. Hover over a bubble to see the full name and tag count. If you follow your nose a bit, the color scheme will become apparent in relation to the pie chart's key.</p>

<p>All of the same limitations I pointed out last year about posts having multiple tags and dilution across related tags still apply this year. If there is any insight into the mind share of the GIS community to be derived from this exercise, it is probably in the aggregate.</p>

<p>The exact StackExchange API URL that generated these results is: <a href="https://api.stackexchange.com/2.1/tags?order=desc&amp;sort=popular&amp;site=gis&amp;pagesize=100">https://api.stackexchange.com/2.1/tags?order=desc&amp;sort=popular&amp;site=gis&amp;pagesize=100</a></p>

<p>The results were generated on 11 September 2013 and subsequent results will vary from those shown here. The Python script used to process the results into CSV <a href="/assets/data/stack2013/handle_json.zip">can be found here</a>.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So the data server that I was working with was having issues and, while waiting for the IT staff to resolve things, I decided to browse the <a href="http://gis.stackexchange.com/" target="_blank">GIS StackExchange</a> site. It's been online for quite sometime now, though I am only an occasional user. One thing led to another and I found myself playing with the <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2012/09/stack-exchange-api-v2-1/" target="_blank">StackExchange API</a>, which returns various information for a particular site in a JSON format.</p>

<p><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2871" height="328" src="http://geobabble.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/gis_se_crop.png?w=1024" title="gis_se_crop" width="1024" /></p>

<p>One of the things that got people excited about the site was that it was neutral territory, not directly controlled by a particular vendor or organization and it remains one of the few places where you can see hyperbole-free discussion of Esri tools right next to that of open-source tools and general GIS concepts. Since it's been online for a while now, it has a lot of posts covering many different topics. I had some time on my hands, so I decided to pull the information for the 100 most "popular" tags, using the StackExchange API. With JSON in hand, I parsed into a CSV with Python and loaded the data into Excel to take a look.  <!--more--></p>

<p>Since tags are user-generated, they run the gamut. To provide a little bit of standardization, I applied some categories to group the tags. I completely made up the categories but tried to apply them consistently. Not all fell neatly into groups so I made a few judgement calls. For example, I threw tags about the Esri Flex API into "Esri Tools" whereas "Flex" went into "Development/Programming." Some may quibble but that's how I did it. Also, the raw numbers indicate the frequency of each tag. Since posts can have multiple tags, there can be a lot of overlap. For example, an individual post could be about ArcSDE ("Esri Tools") for PostgreSQL ("General Database") using the PostGIS ("Open-Source Geospatial Tools") geometry type. So a single post could span a number of categories. The chart below shows how the top 100 tags fell into those categories.</p>

<p><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2863" height="353" src="http://geobabble.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/stackexchange_chart.png" title="stackexchange_chart" width="600" /></p>

<p>I'm not sure that it provides any particular insights into the geospatial community at this point. A true <del datetime="2012-09-13T22:49:27+00:00">analyst</del> <del datetime="2012-09-13T22:49:27+00:00">statistician</del> data scientist can probably poke numerous holes in it. It would probably be good to revisit this in a year to see how things have changed, if at all. What it does say to me is that the GIS StackExchange site has succeeded in being a fairly neutral forum for discussion of GIS tools and concepts and that its user community has a diverse set of interests. Such a forum was sorely lacking before it came online, so that's a win.</p>

<p>For those with a mind for such things, the top tag was "arcgis" with 1659 occurrences and the 100th tag was "export" with 58. The StackExchange API lets you get a max of 100 tags at a time so I stopped at 100 for two reasons: 1) There was a significant dropoff from 1 to 100 and I didn't think the next 100 would add much and 2) I had to assign categories by hand and 100 was as much as I had patience for. The data was downloaded on 13 September 2012 and will quickly become stale. The data that I used <a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/6749645/posts/gis_stackexchange.zip">can be downloaded here</a>.</p>

<p>It looks like my server is online again, so back to work...</p>
