    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So <a href="http://github.com">GitHub</a> <a href="https://github.com/blog/1528-there-s-a-map-for-that">announced</a> that you can now automatically view any <a href="http://geojson.org">GeoJSON</a> files that may be in a repository inside an interactive map driven by <a href="http://www.mapbox.com/">MapBox</a> technology. This simple enhancement to GitHub is probably one of the most significant developments in the geospatial industry in years. I'll explain a little later in this post. It's also important to view this new capability as a great, but limited, first step. I'll discuss that a little later as well.</p>

<p>While it's cool to click on a link and just see a map, it doesn't take long to wonder about how you can use this capability beyond viewing data in GitHub. What follows are three ways to capitalize on GeoJSON in GitHub. Not all are directly related to the new mapping capability, and two have been possible for a long time. That said, the GitHub announcement may draw interest from users who have not previously considered either GitHub or GeoJSON, so I hope these approaches will be useful.</p>

<h3>Embed the GitHub map.</h3>

<p><del>If you click on a GeoJSON file and view the new map in GitHub, a quick view of the page source will show that this map is embedded in an IFRAME object.</del> GitHub provides a <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/mapping-geojson-files-on-github#embedding-your-map-elsewhere">simple embedding method</a> to display the GitHub map in any page. (Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/benbalter">Ben Balter</a> for this update.) It's a great way to quickly publish a data set while also providing access to download the raw data.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><script src="https://embed.github.com/view/geojson/geobabbler/geodata/master/geojson/leonardtown_bldgs.geojson"></script></p>

<h3>Stream the data into your own web map.</h3>

<p>This is not a new capability; if you've had GeoJSON in a repo, you've always been able to do this. That said, if you're checking out GitHub or GeoJSON for the first time as a result of the new mapping capability, this is something you may want to try. I have had a page up for a while showing the <a href="http://blog.geomusings.com/assets/demos/mdq6/">county-by-bounty breakdown of Maryland's marriage equality question from the 2012 election</a> that uses this approach to load the data into a <a href="http://leafletjs.com/">Leaflet</a> map from GitHub and style it. (Incidentally, the tiles in the map are also hosted on GitHub.)</p>

<h3>Stream the data into your desktop.</h3>

<p>A third option is to stream the GeoJSON data directly into desktop GIS software such as QGIS for further analysis. In QGIS, simply need to add a vector, specifying "Protocol" and entering the URL to your GitHub-hosted GeoJSON file. Make sure you use the "raw" URL that looks something like this: https://raw.github.com/geobabbler/geodata/master/geojson/leonardtown_bldgs.geojson .</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://blog.geomusings.com/images/posts/add_geojson_layer.png" /></p>

<p>After a few seconds (or more depending on the file size), it should load into QGIS like this:</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://blog.geomusings.com/images/posts/qgis_github_geojson.png" /></p>

<p>Additionally, the <a href="https://github.com/RBURHUM/arcgis-ogr/">GDAL/OGR plug-in for ArcGIS</a> by <a href="http://www.amigocloud.com/homepage/index.html">AmigoCloud</a> provides a way to get GeoJSON into ArcMap, though you may need to download the data first.</p>

<p>UPDATE: Dane Springmeyer pointed out that TileMill supports remote URLs as well.</p>

<p><div class='embed tweet'><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/geomusingsblog">@geomusingsblog</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/billdollins">@billdollins</a> - very cool, had no idea QGIS supported remote urls.

<p>Those are three (or so) quick ways to capitalize on GeoJSON data in GitHub now. So what next?</p>

<p>I stated earlier that I think the GitHub announcement was one of the most significant developments in years. I think it is best explained by <a href="http://feomike.github.io/post/thoughts-on-disruption.html">feoMike in his recent post</a>. As he points out, GitHub has made it easy to communicate spatial information in a way that is fully consistent with the web. Now that simple mapping is available to a large community of developers, it will be interesting to see where they take it. feoMike offered up a few early examples in his post. It's worth a read.</p>

<p>The GitHub move is great for GeoJSON as a format. I've said in the past that the search for the next shapefile ends with GeoJSON. If the web is this generation's dominant computing platform (it is), then GeoJSON provides a simple, elegant solution for geographic data transport in a manner that the shapefile did for the desktop. Support by GitHub is one more example of the community voting with its code as to what it prefers.</p>

<p>I also said it was a great first step, but limited. The mapping capability is understandably basic, though the documentation shows how you can customize styling somewhat. There is also a point at which the data seems to become too big to render (in either the map or in raw form). Bill Morris has identified this limit to be in the ballpark of 4.5MB, which can be easy to hit with GeoJSON.</p>

<p><div class='embed tweet'><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/byrne_tweets">@byrne_tweets</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/BenBalter">@BenBalter</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/ericg">@ericg</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/ajturner">@ajturner</a> +1 for a solid number on max renderable filesize. 4.5MB is pushing it: <a href="https://t.co/cNTbA5Djqw">https://t.co/cNTbA5Djqw</a></p>&mdash; Bill Morris (@vtcraghead) <a href="https://twitter.com/vtcraghead/statuses/346825523521019904">June 18, 2013</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div></p>

<p>So this means that enterprises won't be dumping terabytes of vectors to GeoJSON and loading them into GitHub. That's a good thing in my book. It is, however, an acceptable solution for small data sets and quick turn-around data sharing. As with all things, you have to go in with the right set of expectations.</p>

<p>The thing I'm probably least worried about is how this affects <a href="http://www.esri.com">Esri</a>. Without any specific inside knowledge of Esri's plans, I suspect some form of official support for GeoJSON isn't far off. There are too many people inside Esri who get GeoJSON for it not to happen. If anything, the GitHub announcement may provide a bit of a push by providing a potentially rich source of data sets to consume. The real question is what form the support will take. In any event, Esri provides enough APIs to enable us to develop our own support for GeoJSON if we need it.</p>

<p>The addition of GeoJSON mapping to GitHub is a very small change in the scheme of that platform, but such small changes can sometimes lead to big shifts. It has been possible for a long time to use GitHub to host geospatial data for applications. The main benefit of this latest change, in my opinion, is its potential to get people thinking about the platform in a different way. With such a visible (and visual) change on a platform targeted at developers, I hope that it will motivate that community to begin experimenting with how far it can be pushed. If a hosted platform with an already-baked-in workflow for change management and version control begins to be viewed as a viable home for spatial data, it has the potential to change how the geospatial community thinks about how it does business.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.linkedin.com/groupItem?view=&amp;srchtype=discussedNews&amp;gid=3300945&amp;item=242507385&amp;type=member&amp;trk=eml-anet_dig-b-pop_ttl-hdp&amp;ut=12tcrQvogVeRM1">Thanks to LinkedIn</a>, I saw that Dr. Art Lembo of Salisbury (Maryland) University is leading an "Open Source/Enterprise GIS Summer Bootcamp" at the university from June 3 - 7, 2013. All of the salient details, including contact information, <a href="http://www.esrgc.org/bootcamp/SUBootCamp.pdf">can be found here</a> (PDF).</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"> <img src="http://blog.geomusings.com/images/posts/river.jpg" /></p>

<p>Having seen Dr. Lembo and his team in action <a href="http://blog.geomusings.com/2013/03/20/the-best-thing-i-saw-at-tugis-2013/">for an afternoon at TUGIS</a>, I think this will be a good way for those who have been wanting to take the leap with open-source GIS tools to get some hands-on experience with core tools like <a href="http://qgis.org/">QGIS</a> and <a href="http://postgis.net/">PostGIS</a>. It's also a great time of year to be on Maryland's Eastern Shore. The LinkedIn discussion says there are still spaces available but the date is coming up soon so you'll want to move quickly if you're interested.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I spent the day yesterday at <a href="http://www.towson.edu/">Towson University</a> attending the <a href="http://www.towson.edu/tugis/">TUGIS 2013</a> conference. The new one-day format was a firehose that showcased the diversity of geospatial work occurring across the State of Maryland. The keynote by <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=44978536">Learon Dalby</a> was well-received and the content of the conference was generally substantive. While the day was a sprint, there was one workshop that really caught my attention more so than I would have thought from its title.</p>

<p>The photo below shows 40 participants of an "Introduction to Free and Open Source GIS Software" workshop getting hands-on experience with <a href="http://www.qgis.org">QGIS</a> and <a href="http://www.postgis.org">PostGIS</a> by working through prepared but realistic scenarios. These scenarios included doing multi-user editing and performing spatial analysis to assess the effects of a potential toxic release over a small town.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"> <img src="http://blog.geomusings.com/images/posts/tugis2013_workshop.jpg" /></p>

<p>The workshop was put together by <a href="http://faculty.salisbury.edu/~ajlembo/">Dr. Arthur Lembo</a> of <a href="http://www.salisbury.edu/">Salisbury University</a> and conducted by him and a team of his students, who not only led portions of the workshop but were also stationed around the room to provide guidance to participants. The scenarios were prepared in printed workbooks that the participants were free to take with them, along with information about how to download the tools. All-in-all, I thought the workshop was very well-designed and presented a thorough overview of the capabilities of these two tools.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>To be sure, the workshop was not all unicorns and rainbows. There were typical glitches such as file system and database permission issues that required on-the-fly adjustments, which Dr. Lembo and his students handled well. Some participants were clearly stumped at points while others were making good headway with the examples.</p>

<p>Many of the participants probably remain committed <a href="http://www.esri.com">ArcGIS</a> users after the workshop while others may very well dig in and more thoroughly explore QGIS and PostGIS, but that's really beside the point. Regardless of what the individual participants decide to do with the information from the workshop, all left with hands-on exposure to the tools that was presented in a manner that was free of hyperbole, FUD, or market-speak. They now have more first-hand information with which to make their own educated decisions as to how they want to proceed with their geospatial technology choices; and that, in my opinion, may have been the most valuable outcome of the workshop.</p>

At the time, I was hoping to dig into it fairly quickly but that didn't happen and I'm finally getting to it. Anyone who has followed this blog for a while knows that I have had <a href="http://blog.geomusings.com/2006/12/17/postgis-and-arcgis-9.1/">more</a> than a <a href="http://blog.geomusings.com/2007/07/10/consuming-georss-in-arcmap-with-inmemoryworkspacefactory/">passing</a> <a href="http://blog.geomusings.com/2012/10/03/cutting-tiles-for-arcgis-server-using-tilemill/">interest</a> in <a href="http://blog.geomusings.com/2010/06/02/importing-data-from-geocommons-into-arcmap/">integrating</a> new <a href="http://blog.geomusings.com/2011/03/02/announcing-weogeo-tools-for-arcgis/">data</a> <a href="http://blog.geomusings.com/2012/08/24/togeojson-and-towkt-for-the-esri-fgdb-api/">sources</a> <a href="http://blog.geomusings.com/2011/08/09/taking-a-look-at-pgmap/">with</a> <a href="http://blog.geomusings.com/2011/11/15/fgeojson/">ArcGIS</a> over the years. This comes from the fact that, as a technology geek, I am fascinated by all forms of technology and enjoy the process of integration and, as a consultant providing services to the Federal Government, most of my customers have standardized on Esri tools. Integrations such as GeoRSS, PostGIS, GeoCommons and GeoJSON have directly benefitted my customers for real-world applications so I continue look for ways to remove the barriers between them and the data they seek.</p>

<p>The GDAL/OGR plug-in caught my attention because it purports to add support for any format supported by GDAL and OGR, similar to the way <a href="http://qgis.org">QGIS</a> leverages them for a wide variety of format support. To get going with it, I downloaded the source and built it in Visual Studio 2010. I only ran into a couple of minor issues. First, a had previously installed the Windows build of OGR on my machine using the <a href="http://www.gisinternals.com/sdk/PackageList.aspx?file=release-1600-gdal-1-9-2-mapserver-6-2-0.zip">distribution from GIS Internals</a>. The project as it came down from GitHub couldn't find the OGR and OSR bindings for C#, so I had to resolve that trivial issue. Next, the plug-in was built for use in ArcGIS 10.1 but I was using 10.0. Because some new interfaces were introduced, the <a href="https://github.com/RBURHUM/arcgis-ogr/blob/master/src/OGRPlugin/OGRPlugin/ogrplugin_utils.cs">current code</a> contains a declaration of  type ISpatialReferenceFactory4, which is a 10.1 interface. I needed to change that to ISpatialReferenceFactory3 to make it work with 10.0. That has been the only change I have needed to make so far to account for the version differences. I plan to add a compiler directive in my fork of the project to account for that and submit it back once I can test it.</p>

<p>As I said before, I previously had installed GDAL/OGR so it was already on my machine and my GDAL_DATA environment variable was set. When I built the plug-in and attempted to use it in ArcMap, it threw an error when I tried adding a GeoJSON layer (also with SpatiaLite) that it could not find my gcs.csv file, which is in my GDAL_DATA location. With a little investigation, I found that the code was resetting that variable at runtime to point to the location of the plug-in binary. I copied the files there and it worked well from then on. I'll probably try to add a way to check for the existence of that variable before setting it. None of these issues were major and I think they were reasonable design choices up front so I am not concerned by them.</p>

<p>At that point, I was able to quickly add GeoJSON and SpatiaLite layers to my data frame in ArcMap. This is pretty exciting to me since the ability to support a wide range of data types was a long-standing goal of zigGIS and I'm glad that Ragi has conquered that with this work.</p>

<p>Because the layers are added using a plug-in workspace, they are full read-only citizens inside ArcGIS. For example, I was able to wire up a couple of models using ModelBuilder and execute clips (clipping a GeoJSON layer with a SpatiaLite layer) and buffers and simple tests. I'm really not a huge ModelBuilder user but I thought it would be a good way to test things out.</p>

<div style="text-align:center;">
<img src="http://blog.geomusings.com/images/posts/buffer.png" />
<div style="text-align:center;font-size: 14px;">Model to test a simple buffer<br/><br/></div></div>


<p>The model above produced a 50-foot buffer around Amtrak rail lines from NTAD 2012 in GeoJSON format. The resultant buffer was written to a file geodatabase. As you can see from the image below, it worked like a charm.</p>

<div style="text-align:center;">
<img src="http://blog.geomusings.com/images/posts/buffer_result_small.png" />
<div style="text-align:center;font-size: 14px;">Results of the buffer model.<br/><br/></div></div>


<p>I achieved similar success with a clip operation so I'm sufficiently confident in trying to package the plug-in up and put it in the hands of some of the analysts with whom I work. All-in-all, the plug-in is a nice piece of work. It's still not fully baked but it's a very solid start and deserves a closer look if you're looking to expand the reach of your ArcGIS investment.</p>
