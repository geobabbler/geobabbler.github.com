    <id>http://blog.geomusings.com/2013/10/23/desktop-not-dead</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In 2011, I gave a talk at the NCGIS conference about the continued dominance of the desktop in the world of GIS. In that talk, my main point was that, regardless of the ultimate destination of GIS data or maps (cloud, server, paper, PDF, etc.), most GIS data passes through a desktop GIS at some point. I don't have hard data to back up that claim but I think anyone who has worked in the industry for any length of time will agree that it feels right. If we loosely define "desktop GIS" to include not only GUI analytical tools like <a href="http://www.esri.com">ArcMap</a> or <a href="http://qgis.org">QGIS</a>, but also command-line tools such as <a href="http://www.gdal.org/">GDAL/OGR</a> and cartographic tools such as <a href="https://www.mapbox.com/tilemill/">TileMill</a>, I think the statement is even more comfortable.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">{% youtube ljIQo1OHkTI %}</p>

<p>Essentially, my claim was that desktop GIS is still the onramp for most of the data we interact with on the web. Over the past few years, geographically tagged live and temporally-sensitive data streams have increased in importance but I think most geospatial data still starts as traditional data sources (rasters, vectors, terrain, etc.) that pass through a desktop for analysis, processing, and styling before moving on to the web. Esri, for example, still features its desktop tools as prominent parts of its web publishing workflow and <a href="http://boundlessgeo.com/">Boundless</a> is working on a <a href="https://github.com/boundlessgeo/suite-qgis-plugin">similar path for QGIS</a>.</p>

<p>The announcement of a Google Maps Engine connector for both <a href="https://github.com/googlemaps/mapsengine-arcgis-connector">ArcGIS</a> and <a href="https://github.com/googlemaps/mapsengine-qgis-connector">QGIS</a> is yet another example of the continued importance of the desktop in the GIS world. Simply put, the chances of a user choosing your platform increases if you can cut to the front of the line and present yourself in their desktop environment. <a href="http://blogs.esri.com/esri/arcgis/2013/10/22/googles-arcgis-toolbar-for-the-cloud/">Andrew Turner did a nice summary of many such integration efforts</a> involving ArcGIS Desktop, although the post fails to mention <a href="http://www.arc2earth.com">Arc2Earth</a>, which I consider the most comprehensive extension of its kind on the market. His discussion tracks with my personal experience in recent years. My most public activities have been <a href="https://code.google.com/p/ziggis/">zigGIS</a>, the <a href="http://blog.dc.esri.com/2010/11/22/toolbars-for-geocommons-and-geoiq/">GeoCommons toolbars</a> (thanks for the mention, Andrew), and the <a href="http://www.weogeo.com">WeoGeo</a> toolbar. I've also built a couple of others for organizations that wanted to get their data products in front of ArcGIS users easily and I am currently working on a live feed extension for a government user. The reality is that I've done more desktop development in the last three years than I had done in the preceding ten.</p>

<p>Andrew's point at the end of his post about Esri's extensibility through various means is quite true. As much as developers love to complain about ArcGIS Desktop and ArcObjects (myself included), I have yet to find a data source that I couldn't integrate using those tools. As I dig into the APIs behind QGIS, I am finding the same to be true there. Despite the tendency to downplay desktop GIS tools these days, I see them continuing to play a significant, if quiet, role in defining how we interact with maps and geospatial data across all platforms for the foreseeable future.</p>

    <link href="http://blog.geomusings.com/2013/10/07/maryland-department-of-planning-bundles-property-data-with-qgis/"/>
    <updated>2013-10-07T12:38:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.geomusings.com/2013/10/07/maryland-department-of-planning-bundles-property-data-with-qgis</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This past week, I got an e-mail from Jim Cannistra, Director of Data Planning Services and the <a href="http://www.mdp.state.md.us/home.shtml">Maryland Department of Planning</a> (MDP), alerting me to a new product available from MDP called <a href="http://www.mdp.state.md.us/OurProducts/PropertyMapProducts/FINDERProduct.shtml">FINDER Quantum</a>. This product bundles Maryland property data and related products with <a href="http://qgis.org">QGIS</a> software to provide users with a fully-functional, free-standing system for interacting with the data. It is designed to replace an older, custom software product, capitalizing on an industry-standard open-source system.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>From the MDP site, the bundled data includes:</p>

<blockquote cite="http://www.mdp.state.md.us/OurProducts/PropertyMapProducts/FINDERProduct.shtml">The product DVD includes the State's computerized property (tax) maps; the x,y linkages (point or polygon) to the Parcel, Computer Assisted Mass Appraisal (CAMA) and Sale datasets; Parcel, CAMA and Sale data, including Sale data via download from the Subscriber Website, from the Maryland State Department of Assessments and Taxation (SDAT); reference grids including a grid for the property (tax) maps, an ADC map book grid, a grid for the Maryland State Highway Administration (SHA) road, stream and feature maps and a grid for USGS 7.5' Topographical quad maps; and additional SHA files including a digital centerline roads file, data derived from SHA digital grid maps, an SHA major roads file and a county boundary file.<br/>
<br/>
Also included are land use/land cover data; congressional and legislative district boundary files; census geography and census demographic data; ZIP code boundary files; Priority Funding Area (PFA) designations; floodplain data, including DFIRM data for selected jurisdictions; protected lands boundaries; watershed data; generalized zoning designations; sewer service area boundaries; public water service area boundaries for selected jurisdictions; National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) Maryland coverage; residential Sales x,y point and summary files derived from SDAT Parcel and Sale data; large-scale, high resolution color digital-ortho imagery and a custom Quantum GIS project file (.qgs).</blockquote>


<p>The MDP site indicates there is a <a href="http://www.mdp.state.md.us/pdf/OurProducts/PropertyMapProducts/Finder/CstFnd.pdf">licensing fee</a> (PDF), which I assume is to cover the management of the data sets and the <a href="http://www.mdp.state.md.us/pdf/OurProducts/PropertyMapProducts/Finder/LicFnd.pdf">license agreement</a>, while acknowledging the GPL license of QGIS itself, seems to place the actual FINDER extension itself outide of any open-source license. (I am not a lawyer so I'll accept guidance on that interpretation.) That said, bundling QGIS with data that the statewide user community values and an application to help exploit it is a great way to get more users on board with QGIS.</p>

<p>To that end, users that choose to take advantage of FINDER Quantum will want to keep in mind that great <a href="http://www.esrgc.org/training/">QGIS-related resources</a> are available via <a href="http://www.salisbury.edu/geography/">Salisbury State University</a> and that training is also available from <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=14036437">Randal Hale</a> of <a href="http://www.northrivergeographic.com/introduction-to-quantum-gis">North River Geographics</a>. Once you have this powerful application installed, you can start to tap into a <a href="http://boundlessgeo.com/solutions/solutions-software/quantum-gis/">deep pool</a> of <a href="http://www.osgeo.org/search_profile">resources</a> to build your expertise.</p>

<p>So kudos to MDP for bundling their data with a powerful mapping, visualization, and analysis tool in QGIS. I hope that, in the near future, MDP considers making the FINDER application itself open-source but this is a great first step.</p>

    <link href="http://blog.geomusings.com/2013/06/18/geojson-on-github-now-what/"/>
    <updated>2013-06-18T16:04:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.geomusings.com/2013/06/18/geojson-on-github-now-what</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So <a href="http://github.com">GitHub</a> <a href="https://github.com/blog/1528-there-s-a-map-for-that">announced</a> that you can now automatically view any <a href="http://geojson.org">GeoJSON</a> files that may be in a repository inside an interactive map driven by <a href="http://www.mapbox.com/">MapBox</a> technology. This simple enhancement to GitHub is probably one of the most significant developments in the geospatial industry in years. I'll explain a little later in this post. It's also important to view this new capability as a great, but limited, first step. I'll discuss that a little later as well.</p>

<p>While it's cool to click on a link and just see a map, it doesn't take long to wonder about how you can use this capability beyond viewing data in GitHub. What follows are three ways to capitalize on GeoJSON in GitHub. Not all are directly related to the new mapping capability, and two have been possible for a long time. That said, the GitHub announcement may draw interest from users who have not previously considered either GitHub or GeoJSON, so I hope these approaches will be useful.</p>

<h3>Embed the GitHub map.</h3>

<p><del>If you click on a GeoJSON file and view the new map in GitHub, a quick view of the page source will show that this map is embedded in an IFRAME object.</del> GitHub provides a <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/mapping-geojson-files-on-github#embedding-your-map-elsewhere">simple embedding method</a> to display the GitHub map in any page. (Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/benbalter">Ben Balter</a> for this update.) It's a great way to quickly publish a data set while also providing access to download the raw data.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><script src="https://embed.github.com/view/geojson/geobabbler/geodata/master/geojson/leonardtown_bldgs.geojson"></script></p>

<!--more-->


<h3>Stream the data into your own web map.</h3>

<p>This is not a new capability; if you've had GeoJSON in a repo, you've always been able to do this. That said, if you're checking out GitHub or GeoJSON for the first time as a result of the new mapping capability, this is something you may want to try. I have had a page up for a while showing the <a href="http://blog.geomusings.com/assets/demos/mdq6/">county-by-bounty breakdown of Maryland's marriage equality question from the 2012 election</a> that uses this approach to load the data into a <a href="http://leafletjs.com/">Leaflet</a> map from GitHub and style it. (Incidentally, the tiles in the map are also hosted on GitHub.)</p>

<h3>Stream the data into your desktop.</h3>

<p>A third option is to stream the GeoJSON data directly into desktop GIS software such as QGIS for further analysis. In QGIS, simply need to add a vector, specifying "Protocol" and entering the URL to your GitHub-hosted GeoJSON file. Make sure you use the "raw" URL that looks something like this: https://raw.github.com/geobabbler/geodata/master/geojson/leonardtown_bldgs.geojson .</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://blog.geomusings.com/images/posts/add_geojson_layer.png" /></p>

<p>After a few seconds (or more depending on the file size), it should load into QGIS like this:</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://blog.geomusings.com/images/posts/qgis_github_geojson.png" /></p>

<p>Additionally, the <a href="https://github.com/RBURHUM/arcgis-ogr/">GDAL/OGR plug-in for ArcGIS</a> by <a href="http://www.amigocloud.com/homepage/index.html">AmigoCloud</a> provides a way to get GeoJSON into ArcMap, though you may need to download the data first.</p>

<p>UPDATE: Dane Springmeyer pointed out that TileMill supports remote URLs as well.</p>

<p>{% tweet https://twitter.com/springmeyer/status/347483526171594753 %}</p>

<p>Those are three (or so) quick ways to capitalize on GeoJSON data in GitHub now. So what next?</p>

<p>I stated earlier that I think the GitHub announcement was one of the most significant developments in years. I think it is best explained by <a href="http://feomike.github.io/post/thoughts-on-disruption.html">feoMike in his recent post</a>. As he points out, GitHub has made it easy to communicate spatial information in a way that is fully consistent with the web. Now that simple mapping is available to a large community of developers, it will be interesting to see where they take it. feoMike offered up a few early examples in his post. It's worth a read.</p>

<p>The GitHub move is great for GeoJSON as a format. I've said in the past that the search for the next shapefile ends with GeoJSON. If the web is this generation's dominant computing platform (it is), then GeoJSON provides a simple, elegant solution for geographic data transport in a manner that the shapefile did for the desktop. Support by GitHub is one more example of the community voting with its code as to what it prefers.</p>

<p>I also said it was a great first step, but limited. The mapping capability is understandably basic, though the documentation shows how you can customize styling somewhat. There is also a point at which the data seems to become too big to render (in either the map or in raw form). Bill Morris has identified this limit to be in the ballpark of 4.5MB, which can be easy to hit with GeoJSON.</p>

<p>{% tweet http://twitter.com/vtcraghead/status/346825523521019904 %}</p>

<p>So this means that enterprises won't be dumping terabytes of vectors to GeoJSON and loading them into GitHub. That's a good thing in my book. It is, however, an acceptable solution for small data sets and quick turn-around data sharing. As with all things, you have to go in with the right set of expectations.</p>

<p>The thing I'm probably least worried about is how this affects <a href="http://www.esri.com">Esri</a>. Without any specific inside knowledge of Esri's plans, I suspect some form of official support for GeoJSON isn't far off. There are too many people inside Esri who get GeoJSON for it not to happen. If anything, the GitHub announcement may provide a bit of a push by providing a potentially rich source of data sets to consume. The real question is what form the support will take. In any event, Esri provides enough APIs to enable us to develop our own support for GeoJSON if we need it.</p>

<p>The addition of GeoJSON mapping to GitHub is a very small change in the scheme of that platform, but such small changes can sometimes lead to big shifts. It has been possible for a long time to use GitHub to host geospatial data for applications. The main benefit of this latest change, in my opinion, is its potential to get people thinking about the platform in a different way. With such a visible (and visual) change on a platform targeted at developers, I hope that it will motivate that community to begin experimenting with how far it can be pushed. If a hosted platform with an already-baked-in workflow for change management and version control begins to be viewed as a viable home for spatial data, it has the potential to change how the geospatial community thinks about how it does business.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.linkedin.com/groupItem?view=&amp;srchtype=discussedNews&amp;gid=3300945&amp;item=242507385&amp;type=member&amp;trk=eml-anet_dig-b-pop_ttl-hdp&amp;ut=12tcrQvogVeRM1">Thanks to LinkedIn</a>, I saw that Dr. Art Lembo of Salisbury (Maryland) University is leading an "Open Source/Enterprise GIS Summer Bootcamp" at the university from June 3 - 7, 2013. All of the salient details, including contact information, <a href="http://www.esrgc.org/bootcamp/SUBootCamp.pdf">can be found here</a> (PDF).</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"> <img src="http://blog.geomusings.com/images/posts/river.jpg" /></p>

<p>Having seen Dr. Lembo and his team in action <a href="http://blog.geomusings.com/2013/03/20/the-best-thing-i-saw-at-tugis-2013/">for an afternoon at TUGIS</a>, I think this will be a good way for those who have been wanting to take the leap with open-source GIS tools to get some hands-on experience with core tools like <a href="http://qgis.org/">QGIS</a> and <a href="http://postgis.net/">PostGIS</a>. It's also a great time of year to be on Maryland's Eastern Shore. The LinkedIn discussion says there are still spaces available but the date is coming up soon so you'll want to move quickly if you're interested.</p>

    <id>http://blog.geomusings.com/2013/03/25/loose-ends</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Just a quick note to tidy up some loose ends related to recent posts...</p>

<p>First, regarding the post "<a href="http://blog.geomusings.com/2013/03/17/a-lazyweb-compendium-of-python-resources-for-beginners/">A #LazyWeb Compendium of Python Resources for Beginners</a>," the University of South Florida PyBulls Python interest group, as promised, compiled a list of Python resources and posted it <a href="https://github.com/PyBulls/learning-resources">on their GitHub page</a>. Thanks to them for their quick response.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"> <img src="http://img.ehowcdn.com/article-new/ehow/images/a06/kv/li/proper-cutting-down-tree-chainsaw-800x800.jpg" /></p>

<p>Second, following up on the post "<a href="http://blog.geomusings.com/2013/03/20/the-best-thing-i-saw-at-tugis-2013/">The Best Thing I Saw at TUGIS 2013</a>," the data and workbooks for Dr. Arthur Lembo's introduction to open-source GIS have been made available. The data <a href="https://github.com/esrgc/qgistraining">can be found on GitHub</a> and the workbooks can be found on the <a href="http://www.esrgc.org/training/">Eastern Shore Regional GIS Cooperative web site</a>. Many thanks for contributing these resources.</p>

<p>These items are embedded in the comments for their respective posts but I thought it would be useful to call them out more prominently.</p>
