    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I've had a couple of people ask me recently about the geospatial tools I use. Year-over-year, that answer changes but here's how I answer that right now:</p>

<p>As a Federal contractor, I spend a lot of time working with the <a href="http://www.esri.com" target="_blank">Esri</a> stack during my work day. A few years ago, I added a few open-source geospatial tools into my tool set and, since then, have also done a respectable amount to consulting work them as well. The balance between the two varies over time, depending on the requirements of individual customers and projects. Lately, commercial customers have seemed much more interested in open-source tools while my government customers are sticking with Esri. Since those observations are based on the the extremely heavy filter of my own recent experience, I'd be hesitant to draw any larger conclusions from them.</p>

<p><img alt="" height="264" src="http://blog.geomusings.com/images/posts/duct-tape.jpg" title="Duct Tape" width="300" /></p>

<p>I've always believed that proficiency with a wide range of tools makes me a better consultant and integrator, so I am always exploring and trying new things. With those commercial customers, and in my own personal side projects, my recent workflows have gelled around a core set of tools, both commercial and open-source: <!--more--></p>

<p><a href="http://www.postgis.org" target="_blank">PostGIS</a> - I am very comfortable with SQL and tend to use <a href="http://www.postgresql.org" target="_blank">PostgreSQL</a> and PostGIS for a lot of my vector data processing. Lately, this has mainly involved joining up geometries with attributes and doing aggregations and similar things. For example, the vector data in this <a href="http://geobabbler.github.com/mdq62012.html" target="_blank">map of the county-level Maryland Question 6 results</a> was processed in PostGIS. Very simply, I have a baseline table of the counties of Maryland which I will use to create new data sets. In this case, I imported a CSV of the election results, created a view that joined up the data and then selected the view into a new table. This is workflow is much easier with PostGIS 2.x thanks to the <a href="http://blog.opengeo.org/2012/03/06/postgis-2-0-new-features-typmod/" target="_blank">use of typmod</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://qgis.org" target="_blank">QGIS</a> - In the case of the map mentioned above, the data set is ultimately going to be static so it makes sense to serve it as static content, rather than bringing a heavyweight geospatial server such as <a href="http://www.esri.com/software/arcgis/arcgisserver/" target="_blank">ArcGIS</a> or <a href="http://geoserver.org/display/GEOS/Welcome" target="_blank">GeoServer</a> into the mix. In these cases, I lean toward <a href="http://geojson.org/" target="_blank">GeoJSON</a>. QGIS makes it very easy to export any vector layer out to GeoJSON so it's become my go-to tool for that. QGIS also has great analytical tools and I consider it a complete functional match for ArcMap but, having said that, I'm actually very comfortable with the spatial SQL functions in PostGIS so I end up doing most of my analytical work there.</p>

<p><a href="http://leafletjs.com/" target="_blank">Leaflet</a>/<a href="http://www.openlayers.org/" target="_blank">OpenLayers</a> - Most of the web maps I'm doing are single-use and pretty straightforward. When that's the case, I prefer to use Leaflet as it's a pretty lightweight library. That said, I keep OpenLayers in the mix if the GIS-like requirements get a little more complex. OpenLayers does more "out of the box" than Leaflet but Leaflet is trimmer so it really depends on the use case.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.arc2earth.com/" target="_blank">Arc2Earth</a>/<a href="http://mapbox.com/tilemill/" target="_blank">TileMill </a>- Arc2Earth is a commercial extension to ArcGIS and I lean on it to make tiles, although it does a lot more than that. I also use TileMill for this purpose but it really depends on where my cartography resides. There's a lot of good cartography locked up in MXDs and Arc2Earth is just a great way to capitalize on that. It's also nice that Arc2Earth works in ArcMap, eliminating the need for a license of Server.  If I'm building my cartography from scratch, which is not really my strong suit, I'll lean toward TileMill because it more easily connects directly to PostGIS, which is where my data tends to reside if I have my druthers. Again, it depends on the use case.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.python.org/" target="_blank">Python</a>/Javascript - I'm doing a lot more work in Python these days. It's become the <em>lingua franca</em> of GIS development in my book. Additionally, the capabilities of Javascript for web maps is evolving at a stunning pace. I can't see being productive in the long term in the geospatial field without proficiency in these two languages.</p>

<p>So these are the tools that I'm using most often these days as part of my personal workflows. The stable of tools that I use evolves over time, as should be evident if you peruse this blog. In general, I'm finding it very easy to be productive with these tools right now.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In celebration of this day when the non-stop political ads, robo-calls, junk mail, and social media posts <em>should</em> finally come to an end. I threw together a little map to show the latest time at which polls close in each state. This should represent, state-by-state, the time (EST) at which you can safely go back to answering your phones. Click the image below to go there (the data takes a couple of seconds to load).</p>

<p>Democracy is a wonderful thing, but it will be nice to have this campaign season behind us.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I had the distinct pleasure of attending my first <a href="http://2011.foss4g.org">FOSS4G conference in Denver</a> last week. Having not attended one previously, I can only rely on the opinions of others that this has been the best FOSS4G yet. For me, this was best geospatial conference I have attended. I'll probably blog in more detail about some of the things I saw but here are my high-level observations:</p>

<li><p><a href="http://www.qgis.org/">QGIS</a> - I didn't attend many QGIS sessions but I didn't need to. It had everyone talking in hallways during breaks. Remember a few years ago when the desktop was the weak link with open-source GIS? Forget about that.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.vizzuality.com/">Vizzuality</a> is doing great things to deploy usable mapping applications on the web with open-source tools. Every session   they led was standing-room only, with good reason.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://vizzuality.com/cartoset">CartoSet</a> and <a href="https://cartodb.com/">CartoDB</a> - from the aforementioned Vizzuality. These open-source tools are designed to help speed the front-end and back-end development of a web application respectively. These are at the top of my list of things to check out.</p></li>
<li><p>One of the key characteristics of most of the open-source tools discussed in sessions I attended is that they originally grew out of the need to solve a problem. They were not just built on spec, hoping someone would find them useful. As a result, these tools tend to already be proven within the problem set for which they were built.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://postgis.refractions.net/">PostGIS</a> - If open-source geospatial is a flowering field, then PostGIS is the water that hydrates it. The amount of tools that support it is staggering (including CartoDB). The importance of a robust, open-source, spatial data store cannot be overstated and the role PostGIS plays as a foundation technology is pivotal. As for PostGIS 2.0, Michael Weisman sums it up best here:</p></li>

<li>Javascript mapping libraries - <a href="http://openlayers.org/">there</a> are <a href="http://leaflet.cloudmade.com/">now</a> more <a href="http://2011.foss4g.org/sessions/geomap-%E2%80%93-new-open-source-javascript-mapping-api">ways</a> to <a href="http://polymaps.org/">get</a> an <a href="http://mapstraction.com/">interactive</a> map <a href="http://www.tile5.org/">into</a> a browser than I can keep track of. Those based on Javascript and/or HTML5 are proliferating like wildfire. The "I" in "RIA" now stands for "intranet".</li>
</ol>


<p>I'm still organizing my notes and thoughts about what I saw at FOSS4G. It's impossible to describe the richness of the information that was available. The only real downtime I had was that which I sought for myself. I'll follow up these quick observations in the near future as I begin to dig into the new tools I was exposed to.</p>

    <id>http://blog.geomusings.com/2011/08/19/SpatiaLite-30-Beta-Is-Available</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Alessandro Furieri announced the availability of the beta of SpatiaLite 3.0.0 on 17 August. It can be downloaded here: <a href="http://www.gaia-gis.it/spatialite-3.0.0-BETA/index.html">http://www.gaia-gis.it/spatialite-3.0.0-BETA/index.html</a>.</p>

<p>Some of the more interesting additions include additional support for topology and the ability to export <a href="http://geojson.org">GeoJSON</a>.</p>

<p>I did a <strong>very</strong> quick test with QGIS 1.7.0 and was able to directly access and edit a table in a database I created with SpatiaLite 3.0.0 so that's initially promising.</p>

    <link href="http://blog.geomusings.com/2010/01/16/QGIS-140-Released/"/>
    <updated>2010-01-16T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.geomusings.com/2010/01/16/QGIS-140-Released</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://blog.qgis.org/node/142">QGIS 1.4.0 has been released.</a> As <a href="http://wherewithal1.wordpress.com/">Terry</a> mentioned on Twitter, that news seemed to get lost amongst the discussion of the GeoDesign Summit and the rebranding of ArcGIS 9.4 to 10.0. I have made use of QGIS in the past and have been perusing 1.4.0 lately. I must state that I am not an analyst nor do I play one on TV but I have been very happy with this release.<!--more--></p>

<p>QGIS has been building a lot of capability over the last few versions, in part because of its integration with GRASS but also partly because of its extensible nature. QGIS features a plug-in approach that allows developers to extend it using Python in addition to C++. This gives the ability for someone to develop plug-ins that run on all of the platforms supported by QGIS, lowering the barriers for third-party developers.</p>

<p>The new release puts a lot of these capabilities out in front of you at start-up. This can lead to a first impression of a cluttered user interface but, in this case, I think it is a good decision. In my experience, users find hiding of capability attractive only if they are very familiar with a application and are comfortable navigating it to find what they need. This is not always true with a new application with which they may be unfamiliar.</p>

<p>Many of the analysts that I work with, for instance, continue to go back to ArcMap because they know what tools it contains and how to access them. I have known for a while that QGIS has had many tools that would be attractive (such as some of the raster analysis tools) but it was not always obvious that those tools were present or how to access them.</p>

<p>The new release resolves that. By putting everything on display, the capability is there to discover. As users get comfortable with QGIS, they can hide tools as desired and gain proficiency in navigating the application.</p>

<p>I am particularly impressed with the support of <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/">OpenStreetMap</a> in QGIS. It provides tools to download OSM data, edit it and upload it from within your QGIS session.</p>

<p>[caption id="attachment_787" align="aligncenter" width="300" caption="QGIS 1.4.0 with OSM data displayed"]<a href="http://geobabble.files.wordpress.com/2010/01/qgis1.png"><img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-787" height="178" src="http://geobabble.files.wordpress.com/2010/01/qgis1.png?w=300" title="QGIS 1.4.0" width="300" /></a>[/caption]</p>

<p>So, I?ve decided that it?s time to put QGIS in front of some of my analyst colleagues again and it?s also time for me to commit to learning how to build a QGIS plug-in. It may finally be the kick in the pants I need to get comfortable with Python.</p>
