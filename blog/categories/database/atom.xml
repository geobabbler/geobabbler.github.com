    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>On what seems to be turning into <a href="http://www.gaia-gis.it/gaia-sins/" target="_blank">SpatiaLite</a> Monday, Sandro Furieri also announced on the <a href="https://groups.google.com/group/spatialite-users?pli=1" target="_blank">SpatiaLite Google Group</a> the availability of a stable version of SpatiaLite for Android.</p>

<p>I am happy to see that this version was developed and contributed back by the <a href="http://www.agc.army.mil/" target="_blank">US Army Geospatial Center</a>. The fact that they contributed back to the project under a standard open-source license is a nice step from a DoD organization.</p>

<p>The message is quoted below:</p>

<blockquote>
Hi List,

I'm really proud to announce you all that finally a rock solid stable and really easy-to-be-deployed binary porting of SpatiaLite for the Android platform is now available for download [1].

[1] <a href="https://www.gaia-gis.it/fossil/libspatialite/wiki?name=splite-android" target="_blank">https://www.gaia-gis.it/fossil/libspatialite/wiki?name=splite-android</a>

Many thanks to the U.S. Army Geospatial Center [2] who very generously contributed this highly appreciated and really useful resource under a genuine free software license (LGPLv3).

[2] <a href="http://www.agc.army.mil/" target="_blank">http://www.agc.army.mil/</a>

A detailed tutorial [3] explaining how-to deploy and use SpatiaLite on Android platforms has been kindly contributed by Andrea Antonello, who spent many long hours during the last week while performing a thorough testing of SpatiaLite-Android, then deciding to publicly share his experiences with the SpatiaLite community. Feel absolutely free to pay a beer to Andrea; he'll surely appreciate ;-)

    <id>http://blog.geomusings.com/2012/11/26/spatialite-4.0-released</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It looks like it was a busy weekend for Sandro Furieri and the rest of the <a href="https://www.gaia-gis.it/fossil/libspatialite/index" target="_blank">SpatiaLite</a> team as version 4.0 was announced on Sunday. There are a number of changes, so it's best to <a href="https://www.gaia-gis.it/fossil/libspatialite/wiki?name=switching-to-4.0" target="_blank">catch up on them</a> before switching over.</p>

<div style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.manningltg.com/fixture_show.php?f_id=GCQ-164&amp;f_desc=Spatialite%20(Quartz%20Halogen)"><img alt="" height="300" src="http://www.manningltg.com/product_imgs/web/GCQ-164_1.jpg" title="Not this SpatiaLite" width="490" /></a><div style="text-align: center;font-size: 14px;">Not this SpatiaLite</div></div>


<p>I have a couple of Federal customers that are integrating SpatiaLite into their workflows so I'll need to take a day or so to assess impacts any impacts there. Looks like the perfect way to slide back into work after a long weekend.</p>

    <updated>2012-03-27T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.geomusings.com/2012/03/27/configuration-management-for-geospatial-data-models</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I wanted to take a opportunity to do something I don't often do, and draw attention to a series of posts that's going on over on <a href="http://www.zekiah.com/index.php?q=blog">my company's blog</a>. About a year ago, my company, <a href="http://www.zekiah.com">Zekiah Technologies</a> joined forces with Upper 90 Systems. Upper 90 was probably best known for their work building tools that supported the Spatial Data Standard for Facilities, Infrastructure, and Environment (SDSFIE), which is a data model that is used by the US DOD to standardize the representation of GIS data for the purpose of performing facilities management on military installations.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.acq.osd.mil/ie/bei/disdi/factsheet_sdsfie.pdf" target="_blank">SDSFIE</a> (PDF) has existed for some time, with several versions of the standard being rolled out to its diverse user community. Through that process, we've learned a thing or two about configuration management of widely-implemented geospatial data models. This understanding has been turned into a series of tools designed to help with the issues surround lifecycle management of a data model (as opposed to physical databases themselves). <!--more--></p>

<p>The approach and tools are loosely referred to as the "platform-independent model", or PIM. We call it that because the model defines the rules that govern how to create and manage a geospatial database in compliance with a given data standard, but the model is not the database itself. As a result, we can support physical implementations on any number of platforms (Esri, PostGIS, Oracle Spatial, SpatiaLite, Bentley, Autodesk, etc.). The tools give users the ability to perform version management, schema generation, compliance checking, profiling, development of migration paths between versions and many other functions.</p>

<p>Barry Schimpf, the former president of Upper 90 Systems and now my colleague at Zekiah, has been working on a series of posts describing this approach and, eventually, the tools. Three posts have gone up with others on the way:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.zekiah.com/index.php?q=blog/2012/01/13/expanding-usefulness-geospatial-data-standards" target="_blank">Expanding Usefulness of Geospatial Data Standards</a>
<a href="http://www.zekiah.com/index.php?q=blog/2012/03/19/applying-flexible-yet-standard-geospatial-conventions" target="_blank">Applying Flexible, Yet Standard, Geospatial Conventions</a>
<a href="http://www.zekiah.com/index.php?q=blog/2012/03/24/understanding-geospatial-data-rules-platform-independent-model-pim" target="_blank">Understanding Geospatial Data Rules in the Platform Independent Model (PIM)</a></p>

<p>The approach Barry discusses has already been leveraged to support Federal data models beyond SDSFIE so we know it is transferable. We think it could have benefits for at the state, local, or regional levels as well. I encourage you to check out the posts and keep an eye out for more as they emerge.</p>

    <link href="http://blog.geomusings.com/2011/08/19/spatialite-30-beta-is-available/"/>
    <updated>2011-08-19T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.geomusings.com/2011/08/19/spatialite-30-beta-is-available</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Alessandro Furieri announced the availability of the beta of SpatiaLite 3.0.0 on 17 August. It can be downloaded here: <a href="http://www.gaia-gis.it/spatialite-3.0.0-BETA/index.html">http://www.gaia-gis.it/spatialite-3.0.0-BETA/index.html</a>.</p>

<p>Some of the more interesting additions include additional support for topology and the ability to export <a href="http://geojson.org">GeoJSON</a>.</p>

<p>I did a <strong>very</strong> quick test with QGIS 1.7.0 and was able to directly access and edit a table in a database I created with SpatiaLite 3.0.0 so that's initially promising.</p>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[So, Which Is It?]]></title>
    <link href="http://blog.geomusings.com/2011/08/17/so-which-is-it/"/>
    <updated>2011-08-17T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.geomusings.com/2011/08/17/so-which-is-it</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>Update:</strong> I pulled this link out of the comment thread below to emphasize it. It seems to answer this question for now: <a href="http://forums.arcgis.com/threads/35676-Edit-spatial-data-with-quot-ArcGIS-for-Desktop-10.1-quot-in-non-SDE-RDBMS-systems">http://forums.arcgis.com/threads/35676-Edit-spatial-data-with-quot-ArcGIS-for-Desktop-10.1-quot-in-non-SDE-RDBMS-systems</a></p>

<p>Since my <a href="http://blog.geomusings.com/2011/08/03/ziggis-the-end-of-the-road/">previous</a> <a href="http://blog.geomusings.com/2011/08/09/taking-a-look-at-pgmap/">posts</a> about <a href="http://st-links.com/default.aspx">PgMap</a> and the shuttering of <a href="http://www.obtusesoft.com/">zigGIS</a>, the nature of the planned support for connecting directly to spatial databases from ArcGIS 10.1 has gotten somewhat muddier.</p>

<p><iframe width="560" height="420" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/zU9lv_WqK6k?color=white&theme=light"></iframe></p>

<p>One of the first indications of direct support was <a href="http://events.esri.com/uc/QandA/index.cfm?fuseaction=Answer&amp;ConferenceID=DD02CFE7-1422-2418-7F271831F47A7A31&amp;QuestionID=3949">this statement from the ESRI UC Q&amp;A</a>.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>This statement, of course, doesn't specifically say anything about editing. I followed up with some people at <a href="http://www.esri.com">ESRI</a> (who shall remain nameless) who said the intent was to support editing of spatial databases in the same manner as current simple feature editing. So there we have it, read/edit from ArcMap without the need of ArcSDE.</p>

<p>Or not...</p>

<p>Subsequently, I have gotten a direct message on Twitter (from someone outside ESRI) indicating that editing will be supported only through the Spatial Data Server (SDS) and will require an SDS license. That seems to be bolstered by this <a href="http://proceedings.esri.com/library/userconf/proc11/uc/tw-pdfs/tw_1472.pdf">PDF from the ESRI UC</a>.</p>

<p>So, at this point, I'll confess to being a little confused. There's a lot of new technology and capability being introduced at 10.1. (Hmmmm, maybe it should be 11.0?) So, given that it's all still in beta, I'll chalk it up to general churn associated with an impending release.</p>

<p>Regardless of what the exact story is, I'm not sure it'll affect any decisions related to zigGIS. If ArcMap isn't supported, PgMap is still a compelling alternative for ArcGIS Desktop users. But perhaps someone from ESRI can help clear this up so the community can know what to expect.</p>
