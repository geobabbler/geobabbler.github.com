    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>On the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/spatialite-users">SpatiaLite Google Group</a> this morning, Sandro Furieri announced the availability of a beta preview of SpatiaLite 4.1.0. The primary focus of this preview is to get early comment on new capabilities supporting the storage, validation, and query of XML documents.</p>

<p>More information about this update <a href="https://www.gaia-gis.it/fossil/libspatialite/wiki?name=XmlBlob+and+VirtualXPath">can be found here</a>. Says Sandro:</p>

<blockquote>
The main goals of these recently introduced enhancements are:<br/>
- storing XML Documents directly within the DBMS <br/>
- supporting XML validation<br/>
- supporting plain SQL queries on behalf of XML Documents <br/>
  via canonical XPath expressions<br/>
<br/>
Implementing directly into the Spatial DBMS a common core of 
XML-oriented features surely is an interesting and useful option,
just considering that ISO- and INSPIRE-Metadata or SLD/SE Styles 
are fully based on XML.
</blockquote>


<p>Although I find myself working more with <a href="http://geojson.org">GeoJSON</a> and <a href="http://developmentseed.org/blog/2011/feb/09/introducing-carto-css-map-styling-language/">CartoCSS</a> these days, I think support for XML is a good step for SpatiaLite. There are some very mature use cases based on XML, as Sandro points out. While <a href="http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/sld">SLD</a> is not my favorite, this may keep it on my radar. Also, it would be interesting to see how this new capability would possibly affect the evolution of the <a href="http://www.opengeospatial.org/projects/groups/geopackageswg">OGC GeoPackage draft specification</a>.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>On what seems to be turning into <a href="http://www.gaia-gis.it/gaia-sins/" target="_blank">SpatiaLite</a> Monday, Sandro Furieri also announced on the <a href="https://groups.google.com/group/spatialite-users?pli=1" target="_blank">SpatiaLite Google Group</a> the availability of a stable version of SpatiaLite for Android.</p>

<p>I am happy to see that this version was developed and contributed back by the <a href="http://www.agc.army.mil/" target="_blank">US Army Geospatial Center</a>. The fact that they contributed back to the project under a standard open-source license is a nice step from a DoD organization.</p>

<p>The message is quoted below:</p>

<blockquote>
Hi List,

I'm really proud to announce you all that finally a rock solid stable and really easy-to-be-deployed binary porting of SpatiaLite for the Android platform is now available for download [1].

[1] <a href="https://www.gaia-gis.it/fossil/libspatialite/wiki?name=splite-android" target="_blank">https://www.gaia-gis.it/fossil/libspatialite/wiki?name=splite-android</a>

Many thanks to the U.S. Army Geospatial Center [2] who very generously contributed this highly appreciated and really useful resource under a genuine free software license (LGPLv3).

[2] <a href="http://www.agc.army.mil/" target="_blank">http://www.agc.army.mil/</a>

A detailed tutorial [3] explaining how-to deploy and use SpatiaLite on Android platforms has been kindly contributed by Andrea Antonello, who spent many long hours during the last week while performing a thorough testing of SpatiaLite-Android, then deciding to publicly share his experiences with the SpatiaLite community. Feel absolutely free to pay a beer to Andrea; he'll surely appreciate ;-)

enjoy, Sandro

    <id>http://blog.geomusings.com/2012/11/26/spatialite-4-0-released</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It looks like it was a busy weekend for Sandro Furieri and the rest of the <a href="https://www.gaia-gis.it/fossil/libspatialite/index" target="_blank">SpatiaLite</a> team as version 4.0 was announced on Sunday. There are a number of changes, so it's best to <a href="https://www.gaia-gis.it/fossil/libspatialite/wiki?name=switching-to-4.0" target="_blank">catch up on them</a> before switching over.</p>

<div style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.manningltg.com/fixture_show.php?f_id=GCQ-164&amp;f_desc=Spatialite%20(Quartz%20Halogen)"><img alt="" height="300" src="http://www.manningltg.com/product_imgs/web/GCQ-164_1.jpg" title="Not this SpatiaLite" width="490" /></a><div style="text-align: center;font-size: 14px;">Not this SpatiaLite</div></div>


<p>I have a couple of Federal customers that are integrating SpatiaLite into their workflows so I'll need to take a day or so to assess impacts any impacts there. Looks like the perfect way to slide back into work after a long weekend.</p>

    <updated>2012-04-02T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.geomusings.com/2012/04/02/2011-tiger-boundary-files-in-spatialite-format</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Over on the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/spatialite-users">SpatiaLite Google Group</a>, <a href="http://www.stineconsulting.com/">Stine Consulting</a> announced the availability of <a href="http://www.stineconsulting.com/GIS%20Resources.php">2011 TIGER Boundary files</a> in <a href="http://www.gaia-gis.it/gaia-sins/">SpatiaLite</a> format.</p>

<p>Despite initial enthusiasm, mainstream uptake of SpatiaLite has been slow but I think that's about to change. Large organizations, such as the US Army, are showing a much more serious interest in SpatiaLite as they expand their use of mobile and hand-held platforms.</p>

<p>I expect that increased availability of data in native SpatiaLite databases will also help adoption. So if you need US boundaries data, check out this offering from Stine Consulting. And, if you're looking for more data for use in SpatiaLite, don't forget that you can download any dataset available on <a href="http://www.geocommons.com">GeoCommons</a> as a SpatiaLite database.</p>

    <link href="http://blog.geomusings.com/2012/03/27/configuration-management-for-geospatial-data-models/"/>
    <updated>2012-03-27T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.geomusings.com/2012/03/27/configuration-management-for-geospatial-data-models</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I wanted to take a opportunity to do something I don't often do, and draw attention to a series of posts that's going on over on <a href="http://www.zekiah.com/index.php?q=blog">my company's blog</a>. About a year ago, my company, <a href="http://www.zekiah.com">Zekiah Technologies</a> joined forces with Upper 90 Systems. Upper 90 was probably best known for their work building tools that supported the Spatial Data Standard for Facilities, Infrastructure, and Environment (SDSFIE), which is a data model that is used by the US DOD to standardize the representation of GIS data for the purpose of performing facilities management on military installations.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.acq.osd.mil/ie/bei/disdi/factsheet_sdsfie.pdf" target="_blank">SDSFIE</a> (PDF) has existed for some time, with several versions of the standard being rolled out to its diverse user community. Through that process, we've learned a thing or two about configuration management of widely-implemented geospatial data models. This understanding has been turned into a series of tools designed to help with the issues surround lifecycle management of a data model (as opposed to physical databases themselves). <!--more--></p>

<p>The approach and tools are loosely referred to as the "platform-independent model", or PIM. We call it that because the model defines the rules that govern how to create and manage a geospatial database in compliance with a given data standard, but the model is not the database itself. As a result, we can support physical implementations on any number of platforms (Esri, PostGIS, Oracle Spatial, SpatiaLite, Bentley, Autodesk, etc.). The tools give users the ability to perform version management, schema generation, compliance checking, profiling, development of migration paths between versions and many other functions.</p>

<p>Barry Schimpf, the former president of Upper 90 Systems and now my colleague at Zekiah, has been working on a series of posts describing this approach and, eventually, the tools. Three posts have gone up with others on the way:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.zekiah.com/index.php?q=blog/2012/01/13/expanding-usefulness-geospatial-data-standards" target="_blank">Expanding Usefulness of Geospatial Data Standards</a>
<a href="http://www.zekiah.com/index.php?q=blog/2012/03/19/applying-flexible-yet-standard-geospatial-conventions" target="_blank">Applying Flexible, Yet Standard, Geospatial Conventions</a>
<a href="http://www.zekiah.com/index.php?q=blog/2012/03/24/understanding-geospatial-data-rules-platform-independent-model-pim" target="_blank">Understanding Geospatial Data Rules in the Platform Independent Model (PIM)</a></p>

<p>The approach Barry discusses has already been leveraged to support Federal data models beyond SDSFIE so we know it is transferable. We think it could have benefits for at the state, local, or regional levels as well. I encourage you to check out the posts and keep an eye out for more as they emerge.</p>
