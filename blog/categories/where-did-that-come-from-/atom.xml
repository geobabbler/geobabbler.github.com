    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hokie Nation has invited everyone to wear their school colors today as a show of solidarity. I will. You should, too. I work with a lot of VT grads. I have seen that their lifelong identification with VT rivals that of Notre Dame alumni.</p>

<p>So, from this Retreiver to all of Hokie Nation: My prayers are with you.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I'm off with the family for a week of sun, sand and frothy umbrella drinks.</p>

<p>I've spent the last couple of days working on a <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/netframework/aa663324.aspx">WCF</a> web service wrapping some <a href="http://postgis.refractions.net/">PostGIS</a> calls. I hope to be able to write about it not long after I get back. I'm also continuing with the ArcCatalog objects for <a href="http://code.google.com/p/ziggis">zigGIS</a> but work has had this funny way of intruding lately.</p>

<p>See you later...</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Greetings to all and wishes for a peaceful and prosperous 2007. And, for those of you keeping track at home, today would be "seven swans a-swimming".</p>

<p>I'm heading out for a business trip tomorrow that keeps me gone for the rest of the week so it's time to pack away the decorations. Typically, we wait until after <a href="http://www.calendar-updates.com/info/holidays/us/threekings.aspx">Three King's Day</a> but my travel schedule won't allow for that this year.</p>
