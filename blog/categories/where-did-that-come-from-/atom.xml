    <id>http://blog.geomusings.com/2008/03/28/Quote-of-the-Day</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Abe Gillespie had the quote of the day in his latest <a href="http://abegillespie.blogspot.com/2008/03/ziggis-update.html">post</a> about <a href="http://code.google.com/p/ziggis">zigGIS</a>.</p>

<p>In describing the development approach (disclaimer: I have been known to dabble in the zigGIS code from time to time although it's been the Abe show recently), Abe described it as "software 2.0" which, in his words, "doesn't mean much, but mostly we're not responsible to deadlines."</p>

<p>That alone was worth firing up the aggregator today. :)</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We were watching "The Real Estate Pros" on TLC last night. This quote caught my attention. A very nice lady was explaining how they were going to cut out the rafters of a house to create a vaulted ceiling because they wanted:</p>

<blockquote>more cubic square footage in the house</blockquote>


<p>Somewhere, her high school geometry teacher cringed.</p>
