    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>tl;dr</strong></p>

<p>This post describes the construction of a simple, lightweight geospatial data service using Node.JS, PostGIS and Amazon RDS. It is somewhat lengthy and includes a number of code snippets. The post is primarily targeted at users who may be interested in alternative strategies for publishing geospatial data but may not be familiar with the tools discussed here. This effort is ongoing and follow-up posts can be expected.</p>

<p><strong>Rationale</strong></p>

<p>I'm always looking for opportunities to experiment with new tools and the announcement of PostgreSQL/PostGIS support on Amazon RDS piqued my curiosity. Over the past six months, I have run into the repeated need on a couple of projects to be able to get the bounding box of various polygon features in order to drive dynamic mapping displays. Additionally, the required spatial references of these projects have varied beyond WGS84 and Web Mercator.</p>

<p>With that, the seeds of a geodata service were born. I decided to build one that would, via a simple HTTP call, return the bounding box of a polygon or the polygon itself, in the spatial reference of my choice as a single GeoJSON feature.</p>

<p>I knew I wanted to use PostGIS hosted on Amazon RDS to store my data. Here are the rest of the building blocks for this particular application:</p>

<ol>
<li><a href="http://nodejs.org">Node.js</a></li>
<li>Express web application framework for Node</li>
<li>PG module for accessing PostgreSQL with Node</li>
<li>Natural Earth 1:10M country boundaries</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Setting up PostGIS on Amazon RDS</strong></p>

<p>Setting up the PostgreSQL instance on RDS was very easy. I simply <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_CreatePorstgreSQLInstance.html">followed the instructions here</a> for doing it in the AWS Management Console. I also got a lot of use out of <a href="http://www.databasesoup.com/2013/11/first-look-at-postgresql-rds-on-amazon.html">this post by Josh Berkus</a>. Don't forget to also set up your security group to govern access to your database instance <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_WorkingWithSecurityGroups.html">as described here</a>. I prefer to grant access to specific IP addresses.</p>

<p>Now that the Amazon configuration is done, your RDS instance essentially behaves the same as if you had set it up on a server in your server room. You can now access the instance using all of the standard PostgreSQL tools with which you are familiar. This is good because we need to do at least one more thing before we load our spatial data: we have to enable the PostGIS extension. I find that it is easiest to accomplish this at the command line:</p>

<p><em>psql -U {username} -h {really long amazon instance host name} {database name}</em></p>

<p>Once you've connected, issue the command to enable PostGIS in your database:</p>

<p><em>CREATE EXTENSION postgis;</em></p>

<p>You may also want to enable topology while you're here:</p>

<p><em>CREATE EXTENSION postgis_topology;</em></p>

<p>This should complete your setup. Now you are ready to load data.</p>

<p><strong>Loading Spatial Data</strong></p>

<p>As I mentioned above, we are now dealing with a standard PostgreSQL server that happens to be running on Amazon RDS. You can use whatever workflow you prefer to load your spatial data.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://blog.geomusings.com/images/posts/pgadmin_rds.png" /></p>

<p>I downloaded the <a href="http://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/10m-cultural-vectors/">Natural Earth 1:10M country polygons</a> for this effort. Once downloaded, I used the DB Manager extension to <a href="http://qgis.org">QGIS</a> to import the data to PostgreSQL. I also did a test import with <a href="http://www.gdal.org/ogr/">OGR</a>. Both worked fine so it's really a matter of preference.</p>

<p><strong>Building the Application</strong></p>

<p>I chose to use Node.js because it is very lightweight and ideal for building targeted web applications. I decided to use the <a href="http://expressjs.com/">Express web framework for Node</a>, mainly because it makes things very easy. To access PostgreSQL, I used the <a href="https://github.com/brianc/node-postgres">node-postgres module</a>. I was planning to deploy the application in an Ubuntu instance on Amazon EC2, so I chose to do the development on Ubuntu. Theoretically, that shouldn't matter with Node but the node-postgres module builds a native library when it is installed so it was a factor here.</p>

<p>After building the package.json file and using that to install the Express, node-postgres, and their dependencies, I build a quick server script to act as the web interface for the application. This is where Express really excels in that it makes it easy to define resource paths in an application.</p>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div></p>

<p>The four "app.get" statements above define calls to get either the bounding box or the actual polygon for a country. When the ":srid" parameter is not specified, the resulting feature is returned in the default spatial reference of WGS84. If a valid EPSG spatial reference code is supplied, then the resulting feature is transformed to that spatial reference. The ":id" parameter in all of the calls represents the ISO Alpha-3 code for a country. You will notice that the application listens on port 3000. More on that later.</p>

<p>The next step is to define the route handlers. In this application, this where interaction with PostGIS will take place. Note that each of the exports correspond to the callback functions in the app.get statements above.</p>

<p>The PostGIS spatial SQL for each function is shown in the "client.query" calls in the code above. This approach is very similar to constructing SQL calls in a number of other application environments. You will notice that a coordinate reference system object is constructed and attached to each valid response, which is structured as a <a href="http://geojson.org">GeoJSON</a> feature. The code currently assumes EPSG codes but that may be addressed in a future version.</p>

<p>The above modules do most of the heavy lifting. The full code for this sample <a href="https://github.com/geobabbler/geo-service">is available here</a>.</p>

<p>To test the application, simply issue the following command in a terminal:</p>

<p><em>node server.js</em> (this assumes you are running from the same directory in which server.js resides. The file extension is optional.</p>

<p>Your web application is now listening on port 3000. In a browser, visit the following URL:</p>

<p><em>http://localhost:3000/countries/irl/bbox</em></p>

<p>This should return a GeoJSON feature representing the bounding box of Ireland in WGS84. You can then test the other three calls with appropriate parameters. To get the bounding box in Web Mercator, go to:</p>

<p><em>http://localhost:3000/countries/irl/bbox/3785</em></p>

<p><strong>Deploying the Application</strong></p>

<p>The application should now be ready to deploy. In my case, I created an Ubuntu EC2 instance (free tier). Using SSH, I made sure Node and git were installed on the machine. Additionally, I installed <a href="https://github.com/nodejitsu/forever">Forever</a> which allows a Node application to run continuously (similar to a service on Windows). This can also be done using an upstart script but I chose Forever. I may switch to using <a href="http://devo.ps/blog/2013/06/26/goodbye-node-forever-hello-pm2.html">PM2</a> at some point.</p>

<p>Now, it's simply matter of installing the application code to the instance via git, wget, or the method of your choice. Once installed, be sure to go to the folder containing the code and issue the "npm install" command. This will read the package.json install Express, node-postgres, and other dependencies. Since some native code is built in the process, you may need to issue the command under sudo.</p>

<p>I mentioned above that the application listens on port 3000. The Ubuntu instance, by default, will not allow the application to listen on port 80. This can be mitigated in a number of ways but I issued the following command to redirect traffic from 80 to 3000. Since this instance is single-use, this approach is sufficient.</p>

<p><em>sudo iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp --dport 80 -j REDIRECT --to-ports 3000</em></p>

<p>Once you are ready to go, you'll want to start the application with the following command:</p>

<p><em>forever start server</em> (again assuming you are executing from the directory containing server.js)</p>

<p>A couple of Amazon notes: 1) You may want to assign an elastic IP to your instance for a persistent IP address and 2) you'll want you remember to configure your RDS security group to allow access from your instance's IP address.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>If everything has gone correctly, you should be able to execute the above URLs (using your instance IP address) and get a response like the following, which you should be able to load directly into QGIS or another GeoJSON-literate client. Altogether, I was able to assemble this in one evening. This small collection of open-source tools, combined with the Amazon infrastructure, seems to provide a straightforward path to a hosted geodata service. This example is intentionally simple but PostGIS provides a robust collection of functions that can be exploited in a similar manner, leading to more advanced processing or analysis. I will continue my experimentation but am encouraged by what I have seen so far.</p>

    <updated>2013-10-17T05:42:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.geomusings.com/2013/10/17/weogeo-now-with-geojson</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It's great news that the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/house-effort-to-end-fiscal-crisis-collapses-leaving-senate-to-forge-last-minute-solution/2013/10/16/1e8bb150-364d-11e3-be86-6aeaa439845b_story.html?hpid=z1">government shutdown is finally over</a>. Many of our colleagues across the geospatial industry can now report back to work, ending a another stressful period for them. During the shutdown, many stepped up to try and fill the gap left by shuttered government web sites that would normally distribute geospatial data.</p>

<p>Among those who stepped into the breach are my friends at <a href="http://www.weogeo.com">WeoGeo</a>, who told me they saw a huge uptick in traffic as the community realized that government data sets such as TIGER and DRG are freely available in the <a href="http://market.weogeo.com/">WeoGeo Market</a>. One of the capabilities that has been quietly introduced into WeoGeo's platform over the last few days is the ability to extract and download TIGER and OSM data directly in <a href="http://geojson.org">GeoJSON</a> format. The embedded video by WeoGeo walks through the customization and ordering process better than I can, but it's great to have the ability to extract fine-tuned data sets directly in GeoJSON format for use in modern web-mapping tools.</p>

<p>Static content has been making a comeback lately, and justifiably so. The truth is that most of the content we interact with on the web won't change over time and complex content management systems (CMS) that dynamically generate HTML and such from databases on every call are really overkill. Sure, there are caching strategies and CDNs and such to hide some of the misery but you can't beat the speed, simplicity, and scalability of static content.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>The same can really be said of maps on the web. Most maps are published to convey some information that has been validated for the point in time in which it was published. Most of the organizations I've worked with, government and commercial, have a release process to vet the contents of a map before it is published. In effect, such organizations are making their map content static. The truth is that, like a CMS, a complex map server probably isn't necessary for most maps we interact with today on the web.</p>

<p>In fact, I can still clearly recall use cases from just a few years where such architectures were not only overkill but counterproductive. We typically distributed analysis results via web-based interactive maps. The results were typically valid for point in time during which an area of interest was studied. We ended up developing versioning schemes to preserve analysis results from being altered by the next bulk data set update. Another tack was to set up a separate map service pointed at a directory of shapefiles. All of this was to get around the basic fact that geospatial data at the time was not web-ready. GeoJSON helps solve that problem.</p>

<p>With modern client-side mapping libraries like <a href="http://leafletjs.com/">Leaflet</a> and <a href="http://www.openlayers.org/">OpenLayers</a>, and with content generation tools like TileMill, it has become increasingly easy to make beautiful, interactive web maps that require no specialized back-end server to deliver geospatial content. With WeoGeo's support, combined with the online editing capabilities of <a href="http://geojson.io/">geojson.io</a> from <a href="http://mapbox.com">MapBox</a>, the validation capability of <a href="http://geojsonlint.com/">GeoJSONLint</a> by <a href="http://twitter.com/JCSanford">Jason Sanford</a>, the <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/mapping-geojson-files-on-github">simple hosting capability of GitHub</a>, and the extended query API provided by <a href="http://gitspatial.com/">GitSpatial</a> (again by Jason Sanford), we are very close to having a complete GeoJSON-centric workflow.</p>

<p>Even as government data sites come back online, there are still good reasons to head over to WeoGeo and check out what they have. The customization capabilities alone (shown in the video above) make it very easy to get data for just your area of interest without having to download a lot of extra, unneeded data. The addition of GeoJSON support, in my opinion, shortens the workflow needed to get from data to information.</p>

    <link href="http://blog.geomusings.com/2013/06/18/geojson-on-github-now-what/"/>
    <updated>2013-06-18T16:04:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.geomusings.com/2013/06/18/geojson-on-github-now-what</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So <a href="http://github.com">GitHub</a> <a href="https://github.com/blog/1528-there-s-a-map-for-that">announced</a> that you can now automatically view any <a href="http://geojson.org">GeoJSON</a> files that may be in a repository inside an interactive map driven by <a href="http://www.mapbox.com/">MapBox</a> technology. This simple enhancement to GitHub is probably one of the most significant developments in the geospatial industry in years. I'll explain a little later in this post. It's also important to view this new capability as a great, but limited, first step. I'll discuss that a little later as well.</p>

<p>While it's cool to click on a link and just see a map, it doesn't take long to wonder about how you can use this capability beyond viewing data in GitHub. What follows are three ways to capitalize on GeoJSON in GitHub. Not all are directly related to the new mapping capability, and two have been possible for a long time. That said, the GitHub announcement may draw interest from users who have not previously considered either GitHub or GeoJSON, so I hope these approaches will be useful.</p>

<h3>Embed the GitHub map.</h3>

<p><del>If you click on a GeoJSON file and view the new map in GitHub, a quick view of the page source will show that this map is embedded in an IFRAME object.</del> GitHub provides a <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/mapping-geojson-files-on-github#embedding-your-map-elsewhere">simple embedding method</a> to display the GitHub map in any page. (Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/benbalter">Ben Balter</a> for this update.) It's a great way to quickly publish a data set while also providing access to download the raw data.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><script src="https://embed.github.com/view/geojson/geobabbler/geodata/master/geojson/leonardtown_bldgs.geojson"></script></p>

<!--more-->


<h3>Stream the data into your own web map.</h3>

<p>This is not a new capability; if you've had GeoJSON in a repo, you've always been able to do this. That said, if you're checking out GitHub or GeoJSON for the first time as a result of the new mapping capability, this is something you may want to try. I have had a page up for a while showing the <a href="http://blog.geomusings.com/assets/demos/mdq6/">county-by-bounty breakdown of Maryland's marriage equality question from the 2012 election</a> that uses this approach to load the data into a <a href="http://leafletjs.com/">Leaflet</a> map from GitHub and style it. (Incidentally, the tiles in the map are also hosted on GitHub.)</p>

<h3>Stream the data into your desktop.</h3>

<p>A third option is to stream the GeoJSON data directly into desktop GIS software such as QGIS for further analysis. In QGIS, simply need to add a vector, specifying "Protocol" and entering the URL to your GitHub-hosted GeoJSON file. Make sure you use the "raw" URL that looks something like this: https://raw.github.com/geobabbler/geodata/master/geojson/leonardtown_bldgs.geojson .</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://blog.geomusings.com/images/posts/add_geojson_layer.png" /></p>

<p>After a few seconds (or more depending on the file size), it should load into QGIS like this:</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://blog.geomusings.com/images/posts/qgis_github_geojson.png" /></p>

<p>Additionally, the <a href="https://github.com/RBURHUM/arcgis-ogr/">GDAL/OGR plug-in for ArcGIS</a> by <a href="http://www.amigocloud.com/homepage/index.html">AmigoCloud</a> provides a way to get GeoJSON into ArcMap, though you may need to download the data first.</p>

<p>UPDATE: Dane Springmeyer pointed out that TileMill supports remote URLs as well.</p>

<p><div class='embed tweet'><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/geomusingsblog">@geomusingsblog</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/billdollins">@billdollins</a> - very cool, had no idea QGIS supported remote urls. TileMill does also: <a href="http://t.co/o3wxv2VkEv">http://t.co/o3wxv2VkEv</a></p>&mdash; Dane Springmeyer (@springmeyer) <a href="https://twitter.com/springmeyer/statuses/347483526171594753">June 19, 2013</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div></p>

<p>Those are three (or so) quick ways to capitalize on GeoJSON data in GitHub now. So what next?</p>

<p>I stated earlier that I think the GitHub announcement was one of the most significant developments in years. I think it is best explained by <a href="http://feomike.github.io/post/thoughts-on-disruption.html">feoMike in his recent post</a>. As he points out, GitHub has made it easy to communicate spatial information in a way that is fully consistent with the web. Now that simple mapping is available to a large community of developers, it will be interesting to see where they take it. feoMike offered up a few early examples in his post. It's worth a read.</p>

<p>The GitHub move is great for GeoJSON as a format. I've said in the past that the search for the next shapefile ends with GeoJSON. If the web is this generation's dominant computing platform (it is), then GeoJSON provides a simple, elegant solution for geographic data transport in a manner that the shapefile did for the desktop. Support by GitHub is one more example of the community voting with its code as to what it prefers.</p>

<p>I also said it was a great first step, but limited. The mapping capability is understandably basic, though the documentation shows how you can customize styling somewhat. There is also a point at which the data seems to become too big to render (in either the map or in raw form). Bill Morris has identified this limit to be in the ballpark of 4.5MB, which can be easy to hit with GeoJSON.</p>

<p><div class='embed tweet'><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/byrne_tweets">@byrne_tweets</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/BenBalter">@BenBalter</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/ericg">@ericg</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/ajturner">@ajturner</a> +1 for a solid number on max renderable filesize. 4.5MB is pushing it: <a href="https://t.co/cNTbA5Djqw">https://t.co/cNTbA5Djqw</a></p>&mdash; Bill Morris (@vtcraghead) <a href="https://twitter.com/vtcraghead/statuses/346825523521019904">June 18, 2013</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div></p>

<p>So this means that enterprises won't be dumping terabytes of vectors to GeoJSON and loading them into GitHub. That's a good thing in my book. It is, however, an acceptable solution for small data sets and quick turn-around data sharing. As with all things, you have to go in with the right set of expectations.</p>

<p>The thing I'm probably least worried about is how this affects <a href="http://www.esri.com">Esri</a>. Without any specific inside knowledge of Esri's plans, I suspect some form of official support for GeoJSON isn't far off. There are too many people inside Esri who get GeoJSON for it not to happen. If anything, the GitHub announcement may provide a bit of a push by providing a potentially rich source of data sets to consume. The real question is what form the support will take. In any event, Esri provides enough APIs to enable us to develop our own support for GeoJSON if we need it.</p>

<p>The addition of GeoJSON mapping to GitHub is a very small change in the scheme of that platform, but such small changes can sometimes lead to big shifts. It has been possible for a long time to use GitHub to host geospatial data for applications. The main benefit of this latest change, in my opinion, is its potential to get people thinking about the platform in a different way. With such a visible (and visual) change on a platform targeted at developers, I hope that it will motivate that community to begin experimenting with how far it can be pushed. If a hosted platform with an already-baked-in workflow for change management and version control begins to be viewed as a viable home for spatial data, it has the potential to change how the geospatial community thinks about how it does business.</p>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[GeoJSON from ArcGIS Server]]></title>
    <link href="http://blog.geomusings.com/2013/06/10/geojson-from-arcgis-server/"/>
    <updated>2013-06-10T09:54:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.geomusings.com/2013/06/10/geojson-from-arcgis-server</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A while back, I posted about <a href="http://blog.geomusings.com/2011/11/15/fgeojson/">my desire to see GeoJSON supported as an output format from ArcGIS Server</a>. I found myself needing that capability so I recently completed, <a href="https://github.com/geobabbler/AGSOpenFormats">and posted to GitHub</a>, a first cut at a server object extension (SOE) for ArcGIS Server 10.1 that enables output of <a href="http://geojson.org/">GeoJSON</a> via an HTTP GET.</p>

<p>Using the SOE is fairly straightforward. If you download the code and build it (ensuring you have installed the ArcObjects SDK for .Net), you can simply move the project outputs to your target machine and use the ArcGIS Server manager to install the SOE. Once you log into the manager application, click "Site" at the top of the page and then "Extensions" on the left. Click "Add Extension" and browse to the .soe file. You should end up seeing something like this:</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"> <img src="http://blog.geomusings.com/images/posts/geojsonserver1.png" /></p>

<!--more-->


<p>After, that you can go back to "Services," choose a map service, select "Capabilities," and you should see "Open Data Formats" as a choice to select. At that point, you should be ready to go.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"> <img src="http://blog.geomusings.com/images/posts/geojsonserver2.png" /></p>

<p>That's all meat-and-potatoes configuration workflow that <a href="http://www.esri.com">Esri</a> has made very easy at 10.1. Once you've been through all of that, you should be able to go to your map service properties using a URL like this:</p>

<p>http://localhost/arcgis/rest/services/SampleWorldCities/MapServer</p>

<p>...and you should see be able to scroll to the bottom and see "GeoJSONServer" (which will change in a future version) as a supported extension.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"> <img src="http://blog.geomusings.com/images/posts/geojsonserver4.png" /></p>

<p>Following that link should take you to a page that shows "GeoJSON" as a supported operation. From there, you should be taken to a page that allows you to enter in a layer number (required) or a query (optional). The layer number is the layer's ordinal shown in the map service properties above. The query parameter can be a SQL WHERE clause that is valid for the layer in question (leaving off the word "WHERE"). This is consistent with how definition queries are handled elsewhere in the Esri REST API. At this point, GET and POST do the same thing though that may change in the future. You can use this form (which is generated by default) to test the SOE and get examples of valid URLs. For example, this URL returns GeoJSON for the continent of Asia from my sample map service:</p>

<p>http://localhost/arcgis/rest/services/SampleWorldCities/MapServer/exts/GeoJSONServer/GeoJSON?query=CONTINENT%3D%27Asia%27&amp;layer=1&amp;f=json</p>

<p>In the process of developing the SOE, I tested the outputs using <a href="http://geojsonlint.com/">geojsonlint.com</a> and the <a href="http://openlayers.org/dev/examples/vector-formats.html">OpenLayers vector format example</a> page (see the following screen shot).</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"> <img src="http://blog.geomusings.com/images/posts/geojsonserver5.png" /></p>

<p>A few nuts and bolts:</p>

<ol>
<li>I refactored my previous <a href="http://blog.geomusings.com/2012/08/24/togeojson-and-towkt-for-the-esri-fgdb-api/">extension methods for the File Geodatabase API</a> to work with ArcObjects for this SOE. The code is functional but I'd call the conversion about 75% complete. A close examination by an experienced ArcObjects developer may lead to some head-scratching as there are some artifacts from the FGDB API oriented code that I'll be cleaning up over the next couple of weeks.</li>
<li>The SOE is currently output-only and only supports attribute queries. I plan to work on the ability to pass in a GeoJSON geometry to do a spatial filter as well but my GeoJSON code currently only persists Esri geometries to GeoJSON but does not yet de-persist. For the sake of consistency, I don't want to mix JSON syntax, so I want to add in de-persistence before implementing spatial filters.</li>
<li>The SOE always transforms geometries to WGS84 for GeoJSON output. The GeoJSON spec doesn't specifically require this; it was just my call.</li>
<li>The SOE has been tested with ArcGIS Server 10.1 only. I don't know if the current code will present any issues with previous versions but I really have no plans to go back and test them. The actual GeoJSON generation shouldn't be much of an issue but I can't speak for the SOE interface itself. Forks are welcome.</li>
</ol>


<p>As can be seen, the code is still under active development but it works in its current configuration. It's actually performed pretty well on a very modest Amazon instance so I'm somewhat encouraged. I'll post some issues to GitHub as a nominal road map.</p>

<p>In a semi-related note, it looks like Marten Hogeweg of Esri is working on integrating GeoJSON support into Esri's portal server project, so users of that tool may want to hold on for that.</p>

<p><div class='embed tweet'><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>So... looking at adding <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23geojson&amp;src=hash">#geojson</a> to <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23esri&amp;src=hash">#esri</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23opensource&amp;src=hash">#opensource</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23geoportal&amp;src=hash">#geoportal</a> server.

<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div></p>

<p>I'm looking forward to checking out Marten's work and am glad to see Esri taking greater notice of GeoJSON.</p>

    <link href="http://blog.geomusings.com/2013/05/30/ogc-abandons-the-web/"/>
    <updated>2013-05-30T10:52:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.geomusings.com/2013/05/30/ogc-abandons-the-web</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Those are my words, not theirs.</p>

<p>It came to light today that <a href="http://www.opengeospatial.org/">OGC</a> has decided to <a href="http://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/discuss/2013-May/011789.html">withdraw the GeoServices REST Specification</a>, also known as the "ESRI REST API," as a proposed standard. I will not take up the relative merits of the specification or the implications of OGC potentially adopting an industry-developed specification that has so much implied workflow embedded in it. With this decision, three facts remain unaltered:</p>

<ol>
<li>The ESRI REST API will continue forward as a widely-used de facto standard in the form of ArcGIS Server installs and other emulations, such as that in <a href="http://www.arc2earth.com/">Arc2Earth</a>.</li>
<li>GeoJSON will continue forward as a widely-used de facto standard in the form of numerous open-source implementations.</li>
<li>OGC still has no JSON syntax.</li>
</ol>


<p>Yes, twelve years after the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON#History">birth of JSON</a>, five years after the <a href="http://webhelp.esri.com/arcgisserver/9.3/java/index.htm#whats_new_93.htm">release of the ESRI REST API and its embedded JSON syntax</a>, and five years after the <a href="http://geojson.org/geojson-spec.html">release of GeoJSON 1.0</a>, OGC is still has no entry in the JSON space. Between Esri and GeoJSON, the utility of JSON in web mapping applications has been roundly proven. In the ESRI arena, find me anyone who willingly uses the SOAP API these days while the adoption of support for GeoJSON across the open-source GIS world speaks volumes. The industry has voted with its feet and its code as to what it prefers.</p>

<p>There's probably a lively discussion to be had about where JSON should fit into OGC's priorities. What is clear, however, is that Javascript and JSON are driving the web at large and the web-mapping space in the geospatial market. With no official stance of any kind in this area, it becomes increasingly difficult to take OGC seriously in matters of the modern web.</p>

<p>Howard Butler had a great point a while back when discussing the potential adoption of the GeoServices REST Specification:</p>

<p><div class='embed tweet'><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/JeffHarrison">@JeffHarrison</a> I think it would be great for OGC to ratify GeoServices. It would cement their irrelevance to current and future developers.</p>&mdash; Howard Butler (@howardbutler) <a href="https://twitter.com/howardbutler/statuses/331405667837542401">May 6, 2013</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div></p>

<p>The irony here is that the withdrawal of the specification accomplishes the same thing. I won't go so far as to say OGC has no clue or doesn't care but, in the perception-is-reality department, they look pretty out-of-touch these days. Is this a problem with process? Maybe. Is it a problem with message? Definitely. The message I've gotten from this whole episode is that we can keep doing what we've been doing with our web mapping applications because OGC has nothing for us.</p>
