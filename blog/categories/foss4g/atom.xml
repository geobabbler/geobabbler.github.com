    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It's rather fitting that the second plenary talk on Wednesday had to do with "firehose" applications since the <a href="http://foss4g-na.org/" target="_blank">FOSS4G North America</a> (FOSS4GNA) conference was something of a firehose in itself. Despite the fact that the event was smaller than the worldwide event in Denver back in October, I came away with the same "full brain" feeling.</p>

<p><img alt="It feels like I never leave this place." src="http://www.visitingdc.com/images/washington-dc-convention-center.jpg" /></p>

<p>Of course, given the recent production release of <a href="http://blog.opengeo.org/2012/04/03/postgis-2-0-released/" target="_blank">PostGIS 2.0</a>, that was kind of the big story for this event. I attended a number of <a href="http://postgis.org/" target="_blank">PostGIS</a>/<a href="http://www.postgresql.org/" target="_blank">PostgreSQL</a>-related sessions and came away with lots of new information. I especially enjoyed <a href="http://twitter.com/pwramsey" target="_blank">Paul Ramsey's</a> "what's new" talk on Wednesday. One thing I enjoy about his talks (here and in Denver) is that he's not afraid to throw sample SQL up on the screen. It's one thing to hear about a new feature but it's another thing entirely to see a concrete example. Some may find the idea of raw SQL in a presentation abhorrent but it worked for me. <!--more--></p>

<p>I've already started playing with PostGIS 2.0 but haven't gotten terribly far so these sessions helped a lot. It's already been pretty well vetted by the community during it's various pre-release stages so it seems remarkably stable. With the addition of topology and raster analysis in addition to 3D/4D indexing and new vector functions, PostGIS probably handles the majority of what most users would need for GIS analysis at the database level. I'm excited to dig deeper.</p>

<p>I also attended a few web-mapping themed talks. If there is one word that consistently and repeatedly passed the lips of most of the presenters, it was "<a href="http://geojson.org/" target="_blank">GeoJSON</a>." I've <a href="http://blog.geomusings.com/?s=geojson" target="_blank">blogged about GeoJSON</a> in the past but it really is the oil that makes the modern geo-web run smoothly. The rate of adoption it is receiving rivals only one other <em>de facto</em> standard that I can recall: you may remember something called the shapefile. The fact is that anyone who's been hunting through their file system looking for the "next shapefile" has been looking in the wrong place. It lives behind that nice map in your browser. The shapefile took off because it solved a problem for what was the frontier of GIS in the 1990s; the transition from heavy workstations to desktop mapping. GeoJSON solves the problem of delivering vector spatial data for today's frontier; the transition from the desktop GIS to web mapping. It's that simple. We don't need another file format to solve an old problem that already has a solution.</p>

<p>Of course, there was a lot more. I got introduced to <a href="http://cartodb.com/" target="_blank">CartoDB</a> in Denver, have <a href="http://blog.geomusings.com/2011/10/13/cartodb-leaflet-easy/" target="_blank">experimented with it</a> since then and was able to get an update on its 1.0 release at one of the sessions. It remains a compelling option for spatial data hosting and <a href="http://vizzuality.com/" target="_blank">Vizzuality</a> are actively engaging with the open-source communities that build the tools they use. On the cartography side of things, <a href="http://stamen.com/" target="_blank">Stamen</a> continues to show how beautiful maps can be made with open-source tools. Similarly, <a href="http://mapbox.com/" target="_blank">MapBox</a> showed how they efficiently deliver high-quality maps on the web. For my money, the unsung hero of what MapBox is doing is <a href="http://mapbox.com/mbtiles-spec/utfgrid/" target="_blank">UTFGrid</a>. I hadn't delved into it deeply until I saw the announcement that <a href="http://www.openlayers.org/" target="_blank">OpenLayers</a> now supports it. UTFGrid is breathtakingly elegant in its approach to delivering richer content with tiles. I expect that, in a few years, UTFGrid will be a standard part under the hood of any web mapping experience, like tiles and slippy maps are today.</p>

<p>The only consistent criticism I heard was that most of the sessions were "too technical." I can see some validity to this, given that the event was held in Washington, DC and many higher-level government or policy types who may have been seeking to conceptually understand open-source geospatial may have been put off. Commercial vendors have addressed this problem with the establishment of "executive tracks" at their events. That said, if that's the biggest criticism that can be leveled, then FOSS4GNA was a rousing success in my book.</p>

<p>I have resolved that I will take at least one of my kids, if not both, to the next FOSS4G event that I attend. The attitude of the open-source crowd is one that I want to rub off on them. Aside from the energy that is exuded from a gathering such as this, the open-source world is full of people who see a problem and just set out to solve it. I want my kids to be exposed to that kind of initiative and understand the power that can come from harnessing it, even if they never go into a technical field.</p>

<p>My understanding is that FOSS4GNA came together very quickly. Given that, it was a very high-quality conference and the organizers should be commended. Early tongue-in-cheek commentary referred to it as the "<a href="http://opengeo.org/" target="_blank">OpenGeo </a>User Conference." I felt like there was good balance and, when I attended sessions given by OpenGeo staff, I didn't feel like I was beaten over the head with the OpenGeo brand. All-in-all, I found my day-and-a-half at FOSS4GNA to be very beneficial and I'm hoping it becomes an annual event. (<strong>Update</strong>: It looks like next year's FOSS4GNA <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/foss4gna/status/190517270928293888" target="_blank">will be in Minnesota</a>.)</p>

    <id>http://blog.geomusings.com/2012/02/03/dcmdva-area-geo-event-scene-getting-more-active</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There was a time only a few years ago when, if you lived in the DC/MD/VA area, planning your geo-conference schedule for the year went something like this: Register for the ESRI FedUC and then start booking plane tickets for everything else. That is no longer the case with more events occurring in the area. Here's a round-up of a few events that are on my 2012 schedule so far:</p>

<div style="text-align:center;"><img alt="" height="536" src="http://geobabble.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/foss4g_lanyard_small.png" title="foss4g_lanyard_small" width="495" /><div style="text-align:center;font-size: 14px;">You can never have too many of these...<br/><br/></div></div>


<p><a href="http://www.esri.com/events/fedcon/index.html">ESRI Federal GIS Conference</a> (formerly known as the Federal User Conference): 22 - 24 February. This is probably one of the longest-running and largest events in the area. This year features another <a href="http://www.esri.com/events/fedcon/agenda/dev-geo.html">DevGeo</a> session, focusing on developing applications with the various ESRI tools. Last year was the first time it was done at a FedUC and the room was packed all day. This conference is obviously an ESRI show but the last few years have included unofficial, after-hours gatherings of people working with a wide range of geospatial tools. Even if you are not an ESRI user, there may be something going on in the vicinity that would be worthwhile. <!--more--></p>

<p><a href="http://www.towson.edu/tugis/">TUGIS 2012</a>: 19 - 20 March. I hesitated to list this because the last thing you want to do is suggest to someone from Baltimore that they are in the DC area. So let me clarify: This is NOT technically a DC-area event but it draws a lot of attendees from the DC area. It's also probably the longest running GIS-related event in the region, celebrating its 25th year this year. The organizers at Towson do a good job of mixing up the program so it's not as overtly "Federal" as events farther down I-95 can be.</p>

<p><a href="http://foss4g-na.org/">FOSS4G North America</a>: 10 - 12 April. This event was the topic of my <a href="http://blog.geomusings.com/2012/01/23/foss4g-north-america-to-be-held-in-washington-dc/">previous post</a>. Clearly, it's intended to be a North American event and I would expect it to move around year-to-year so I'll just be happy for the good fortune that <a href="http://www.osgeo.org/">OSGEO</a> decided to inaugurate it in my back yard. It makes perfect sense as there is growing interest in, and adoption of, open-source geospatial tools in the Federal Government.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.wherecampdc.org/">WhereCampDC 2012</a>: Dates TBD. <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/kelsosCorner/status/156469857704083457">I have heard rumblings</a> but haven't seen details. Last year's event was great and I hope it is reprised this year.</p>

<p>There are also a couple of interesting recurring events that have taken root in the area:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.meetup.com/Geo-DC/">Geo DC Meetups</a> - This is an independent group that meets the first Wednesday of every month and covers a wide range of topics. Given that I live out in the provinces, I don't get into the city as much as I would like for these but the group has been gaining momentum. It seems to be doing a good job of building a community of geo-minded people in the area.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.meetup.com/DevMeetUpNortheast/">ESRI Dev Meetups</a>: These meetups are ostensibly focused on application development with ESRI tools but, in practice, the content of the talks cover a wide variety of issues and tools. There have been talks regarding integration of ESRI tools with other geospatial platforms, best practices, case studies, etc. The nice part about these events is that ESRI doesn't want their staff doing the talking. They just book the venue and put out the refreshments. These meetups occur as part of ESRI's Northeast regional effort to establish these events so they don't occur as frequently as the Geo DC events.</p>

<p>This level of activity in the region is good to see as the potential for a vibrant community has always been there. There are lots of people involved in making this happen but the people at <a href="http://developmentseed.org/">Development Seed</a>, <a href="http://www.geoiq.com">GeoIQ</a> and <a href="http://www.esri.com">ESRI</a> have been particularly proactive in energizing their respective constituencies and the results seem to be beneficial for all.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I'm quite happy to see (HT, <a href="http://blog.gisuser.com/2012/01/23/north-america-gets-their-own-foss4g-conference-in-d-c/" target="_blank">Glenn Letham</a>) that <a href="http://www.osgeo.org/" target="_blank">OSGEO</a> is inaugurating an annual <a href="http://foss4g-na.org/" target="_blank">FOSS4G North America</a> conference this year in Washington, DC on April 10-12, 2012.</p>

<p>DC is an appropriate place for this event because of the presence or arguably the single largest user of geospatial technology, the US Federal Government. I'm happy to see that <a href="http://twitter.com/Byrne_Tweets" target="_blank">Michael Byrne</a> is the keynote speaker as the <a href="http://broadbandmap.gov/" target="_blank">FCC National Broadband Map</a> has been a great success story in the use of open-source geospatial tools at the Federal level. I've been seeing more activity within the Federal Government recently but there's still a long way to go.</p>

<p>I know a lot of people in this area that couldn't make it out to Denver last year for FOSS4G. I hope many of them come to this edition to see the state of the art in open-source geospatial tools. I know this conference is targeted to North America as a whole but, if you are in the DC area and active with geospatial technology, FOSS4G North America should be on your calendar.</p>

    <link href="http://blog.geomusings.com/2011/10/13/cartodb-leaflet-easy/"/>
    <updated>2011-10-13T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.geomusings.com/2011/10/13/cartodb-leaflet-easy</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One of the biggest sources of buzz at <a href="http://2011.foss4g.org/">FOSS4G</a> was <a href="http://cartodb.com">CartoDB</a>. It is a hosted solution from <a href="http://vizzuality.com/">Vizzuality</a> that uses <a href="http://postgis.org/">PostGIS</a> to allow you to store your spatial data online. I got a beta account a couple of weeks ago but life (i.e. paying work) kept getting in the way but I finally got to play with it recently.</p>

<p>One of the things that intrigued me is that, similar to <a href="http://www.google.com/fusiontables/Home/">Google Fusion Tables</a>, CartoDB exposes a SQL interface through a RESTful API (I'm still not sure if the term "API" applies to REST but it's a convenient shorthand). Essentially, CartoDB exposes PostgreSQL SQL and the spatial SQL extensions of PostGIS. Once your data is loaded, you can query it and return the results as either CartoDB's JSON syntax, KML or <a href="http://geojson.org">GeoJSON</a>.</p>

<p>With this information, I set out to build a simple application to query property data and display the results on a map in a browser. In addition to CartoDB, I elected to use the <a href="http://leaflet.cloudmade.com/">Leaflet</a> Javascript library to accomplish the mapping (although I also experimented with OpenLayers). Displaying and styling GeoJSON in Leaflet is very straightforward and this task gave me and excuse to get a little more comfortable with it.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>For starters, I downloaded building footprints for St. Mary's County, Maryland (freely available <a href="http://www.stmarysmd.com/gis/">here</a>). The footprints themselves are countywide so I also downloaded the boundary for Leonardtown, Maryland and used <a href="http://qgis.org/">QGIS</a> to clip out just those buildings that fell within the town boundary. Once my data was prepped, I uploaded it into CartoDB.</p>

<div style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" class="size-full wp-image-2134" height="359" src="http://geobabble.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/cartodb_upload.png" title="cartodb_upload" width="590" /><div style="text-align: center; font-size: 14px">The CartoDB uploader is very easy to use.<br /></div></div>


<p>Once the data is uploaded and made public, it is as easy as a URL to pull down the GeoJSON (or even KML). Click here:</p>

<p><a href="http://geomusings.cartodb.com/api/v1/sql?q=SELECT%20*%20FROM%20leonardtown_bldgs&amp;format=geojson">http://geomusings.cartodb.com/api/v1/sql?q=SELECT%20*%20FROM%20leonardtown_bldgs&amp;format=geojson</a></p>

<p>You'll notice that some SQL is embedded in the URL. Finding the commercial properties in the data set is as simple as adding a WHERE clause:</p>

<p><a href="http://geomusings.cartodb.com/api/v1/sql?q=SELECT%20*%20FROM%20leonardtown_bldgs%20WHERE%20structure_%20=%20'Commercial'&amp;format=geojson">http://geomusings.cartodb.com/api/v1/sql?q=SELECT%20*%20FROM%20leonardtown_bldgs%20WHERE%20structure_%20=%20'Commercial'&amp;format=geojson</a></p>

<p>This became the basis of my sample application. I decided to do a simple property finder that allows a user to find buildings by property type and square footage. As I mentioned, it's very easy to use GeoJSON with Leaflet. Here is the Javascript function that fetches the buildings from CartoDB and adds them to the map. It uses jQuery to do the actual fetch and then processes the result, adding the features into a Leaflet GeoJSON layer.</p>

<p><del datetime="2011-10-14T14:44:58+00:00">If you look closely, you'll notice the use of a proxy handler to get past the same origin restriction. This handler is written in .Net. I had been using a Python proxy but urllib2 was indicating header errors in the return from CartoDB so I fell back to this one. I'll dig into that more later.</del> (Thanks to <a href="http://twitter.com/jatorre">Javier de la Torre</a> for straightening me out with the use of a callback.) The above routine is basically the template for all the work in the app. Aside from the basemap tiles, the app loads the town boundary and the buildings from CartoDB. A similar funtion drives the query function, building and passing a WHERE clause to CartoDB. The image below shows the interface with query results in blue. The popups are performed by Leaflet.</p>

<div style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" class="size-full wp-image-2139" height="300" src="http://geobabble.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/propfinder.png" title="propfinder" width="590" /><div style="text-align: center; font-size: 14px">Selected buildings are shown in blue with popups to display the property details<br /></div></div>


<p>All told, this app took about 3 or so hours to build and deploy. This version doesn't actually make use of any spatial SQL yet but I'll add that soon. The live demo can be found here: <a href="http://demo.zekiah.com/propfinder/">http://demo.zekiah.com/propfinder/</a> (give the buildings a few seconds to load). It seems to work well in Firefox and Chrome and is functional, although clunky, in IE9. I haven't tried Safari or earlier versions of IE.</p>

<p>CartoDB is still in beta but already seems solid and is definitely powerful. As a hosted solution, there are associated costs but that's to be expected. I'll keep playing with it but it's already impressive.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I had the distinct pleasure of attending my first <a href="http://2011.foss4g.org">FOSS4G conference in Denver</a> last week. Having not attended one previously, I can only rely on the opinions of others that this has been the best FOSS4G yet. For me, this was best geospatial conference I have attended. I'll probably blog in more detail about some of the things I saw but here are my high-level observations:</p>

<div style="text-align:center;"><img alt="" height="266" src="http://geobabble.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/rotary_sign3.jpg" title="rotary_sign3" width="300" /><div style="text-align:center;font-size: 14px;">It&#039;s time to refresh your thinking about open-source geospatial tools.<br/><br/></div></div>

<li><p><a href="http://www.qgis.org/">QGIS</a> - I didn't attend many QGIS sessions but I didn't need to. It had everyone talking in hallways during breaks. Remember a few years ago when the desktop was the weak link with open-source GIS? Forget about that.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.vizzuality.com/">Vizzuality</a> is doing great things to deploy usable mapping applications on the web with open-source tools. Every session   they led was standing-room only, with good reason.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://vizzuality.com/cartoset">CartoSet</a> and <a href="https://cartodb.com/">CartoDB</a> - from the aforementioned Vizzuality. These open-source tools are designed to help speed the front-end and back-end development of a web application respectively. These are at the top of my list of things to check out.</p></li>
<li><p>One of the key characteristics of most of the open-source tools discussed in sessions I attended is that they originally grew out of the need to solve a problem. They were not just built on spec, hoping someone would find them useful. As a result, these tools tend to already be proven within the problem set for which they were built.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://postgis.refractions.net/">PostGIS</a> - If open-source geospatial is a flowering field, then PostGIS is the water that hydrates it. The amount of tools that support it is staggering (including CartoDB). The importance of a robust, open-source, spatial data store cannot be overstated and the role PostGIS plays as a foundation technology is pivotal. As for PostGIS 2.0, Michael Weisman sums it up best here:</p></li>

<li>Javascript mapping libraries - <a href="http://openlayers.org/">there</a> are <a href="http://leaflet.cloudmade.com/">now</a> more <a href="http://2011.foss4g.org/sessions/geomap-%E2%80%93-new-open-source-javascript-mapping-api">ways</a> to <a href="http://polymaps.org/">get</a> an <a href="http://mapstraction.com/">interactive</a> map <a href="http://www.tile5.org/">into</a> a browser than I can keep track of. Those based on Javascript and/or HTML5 are proliferating like wildfire. The "I" in "RIA" now stands for "intranet".</li>
</ol>


<p>I'm still organizing my notes and thoughts about what I saw at FOSS4G. It's impossible to describe the richness of the information that was available. The only real downtime I had was that which I sought for myself. I'll follow up these quick observations in the near future as I begin to dig into the new tools I was exposed to.</p>
