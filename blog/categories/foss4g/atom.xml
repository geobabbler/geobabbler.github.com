    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One of the biggest sources of buzz at <a href="http://2011.foss4g.org/">FOSS4G</a> was <a href="http://cartodb.com">CartoDB</a>. It is a hosted solution from <a href="http://vizzuality.com/">Vizzuality</a> that uses <a href="http://postgis.org/">PostGIS</a> to allow you to store your spatial data online. I got a beta account a couple of weeks ago but life (i.e. paying work) kept getting in the way but I finally got to play with it recently.</p>

<p>One of the things that intrigued me is that, similar to <a href="http://www.google.com/fusiontables/Home/">Google Fusion Tables</a>, CartoDB exposes a SQL interface through a RESTful API (I'm still not sure if the term "API" applies to REST but it's a convenient shorthand). Essentially, CartoDB exposes PostgreSQL SQL and the spatial SQL extensions of PostGIS. Once your data is loaded, you can query it and return the results as either CartoDB's JSON syntax, KML or <a href="http://geojson.org">GeoJSON</a>.</p>

<p>With this information, I set out to build a simple application to query property data and display the results on a map in a browser. In addition to CartoDB, I elected to use the <a href="http://leaflet.cloudmade.com/">Leaflet</a> Javascript library to accomplish the mapping (although I also experimented with OpenLayers). Displaying and styling GeoJSON in Leaflet is very straightforward and this task gave me and excuse to get a little more comfortable with it.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>For starters, I downloaded building footprints for St. Mary's County, Maryland (freely available <a href="http://www.stmarysmd.com/gis/">here</a>). The footprints themselves are countywide so I also downloaded the boundary for Leonardtown, Maryland and used <a href="http://qgis.org/">QGIS</a> to clip out just those buildings that fell within the town boundary. Once my data was prepped, I uploaded it into CartoDB.</p>

<div style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" class="size-full wp-image-2134" height="359" src="http://geobabble.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/cartodb_upload.png" title="cartodb_upload" width="590" /><div style="text-align: center; font-size: 14px">The CartoDB uploader is very easy to use.<br /></div></div>


<p>Once the data is uploaded and made public, it is as easy as a URL to pull down the GeoJSON (or even KML). Click here:</p>

<p><a href="http://geomusings.cartodb.com/api/v1/sql?q=SELECT%20*%20FROM%20leonardtown_bldgs&amp;format=geojson">http://geomusings.cartodb.com/api/v1/sql?q=SELECT%20*%20FROM%20leonardtown_bldgs&amp;format=geojson</a></p>

<p>You'll notice that some SQL is embedded in the URL. Finding the commercial properties in the data set is as simple as adding a WHERE clause:</p>

<p><a href="http://geomusings.cartodb.com/api/v1/sql?q=SELECT%20*%20FROM%20leonardtown_bldgs%20WHERE%20structure_%20=%20'Commercial'&amp;format=geojson">http://geomusings.cartodb.com/api/v1/sql?q=SELECT%20*%20FROM%20leonardtown_bldgs%20WHERE%20structure_%20=%20'Commercial'&amp;format=geojson</a></p>

<p>This became the basis of my sample application. I decided to do a simple property finder that allows a user to find buildings by property type and square footage. As I mentioned, it's very easy to use GeoJSON with Leaflet. Here is the Javascript function that fetches the buildings from CartoDB and adds them to the map. It uses jQuery to do the actual fetch and then processes the result, adding the features into a Leaflet GeoJSON layer.</p>

<p><del datetime="2011-10-14T14:44:58+00:00">If you look closely, you'll notice the use of a proxy handler to get past the same origin restriction. This handler is written in .Net. I had been using a Python proxy but urllib2 was indicating header errors in the return from CartoDB so I fell back to this one. I'll dig into that more later.</del> (Thanks to <a href="http://twitter.com/jatorre">Javier de la Torre</a> for straightening me out with the use of a callback.) The above routine is basically the template for all the work in the app. Aside from the basemap tiles, the app loads the town boundary and the buildings from CartoDB. A similar funtion drives the query function, building and passing a WHERE clause to CartoDB. The image below shows the interface with query results in blue. The popups are performed by Leaflet.</p>

<div style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" class="size-full wp-image-2139" height="300" src="http://geobabble.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/propfinder.png" title="propfinder" width="590" /><div style="text-align: center; font-size: 14px">Selected buildings are shown in blue with popups to display the property details<br /></div></div>


<p>All told, this app took about 3 or so hours to build and deploy. This version doesn't actually make use of any spatial SQL yet but I'll add that soon. The live demo can be found here: <a href="http://demo.zekiah.com/propfinder/">http://demo.zekiah.com/propfinder/</a> (give the buildings a few seconds to load). It seems to work well in Firefox and Chrome and is functional, although clunky, in IE9. I haven't tried Safari or earlier versions of IE.</p>

<p>CartoDB is still in beta but already seems solid and is definitely powerful. As a hosted solution, there are associated costs but that's to be expected. I'll keep playing with it but it's already impressive.</p>

    <link href="http://blog.geomusings.com/2011/09/07/Using-Dynamic-Non-Spatial-Data-In-GeoCommons/"/>
    <updated>2011-09-07T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.geomusings.com/2011/09/07/Using-Dynamic-Non-Spatial-Data-In-GeoCommons</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In <a href="http://blog.geomusings.com/2011/08/30/prying-data-open/">my previous post</a>, I described how I used a Python script to scrape power outage information from a local web site and convert it into an RSS feed. In this post, I'll show how I used GeoCommons to visualize the changing information over time.</p>

<p>The process starts by creating a data set in GeoCommmons based on a URL link to the feed created in the previous post. The general process for doing that can be found <a href="http://geocommons.com/help/User_Manual#Add-a-URL-Link-from-the-web">here</a> in the GeoCommons documentation.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>My feed is not a GeoRSS feed so it has no location data of its own for GeoCommons to work with. During the upload process, I reached this screen, which starts the process of helping to attach location to my data.</p>

<p><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2037" height="388" src="http://geobabble.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/geocommons4.png" title="Geolocating data in GeoCommons" width="590" /></p>

<p>The feed summarizes power outage by ZIP code so I chose "Join with a boundary dataset" so that I could join it with ZIP code boundaries I had previously uploaded.</p>

<p>I selected the attribute in my feed (title) that was to be used to join with a corresponding attribute in the boundary data set (Zip) as shown below.</p>

<p><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2038" height="345" src="http://geobabble.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/geocommons6.png" title="GeoCommons6" width="590" /></p>

<p>You'll notice that the success message indicates three features were matched. This is true for this version of the feed because ZIP codes with zero power outages are not reported. The join, however, updates itself as the feed updates so more or less polygons may appear in the current version, depending upon feed content.</p>

<p>After reviewing my data and providing some basic metadata, GeoCommons performed the join and my data set was ready to go.</p>

<p><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2041" height="443" src="http://geobabble.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/geocommons9.png" title="Completed data set" width="554" /></p>

<p>In the image above, you'll notice a link labeled "fetch latest." That link, which is formatted as "http://geocommons.com/overlays/{overlayid}/fetch," can be used to manually get the latest version of the feed, which is stored by GeoCommons. Essentially, GeoCommons stores the state of each feature in the data set as the feed is fetched so you build a "version history" your data. As long as you have a date/time attribute, you can use GeoCommons to visualize the changes over time.</p>

<p>In addition to the Python code from previous post, I also used a variant on the script found at <a href="http://www.voidspace.org.uk/python/articles/authentication.shtml">http://www.voidspace.org.uk/python/articles/authentication.shtml</a>. The fetching capability requires authentication so I modified the script to call the "fetch" URL using my GeoCommons user name and password. The script may be overkill but work perfectly without any changes.</p>

<p>On the server, I wrote a four-line batch file to act as a driver for the whole process. This batch file is what is called by a scheduled task in Windows.</p>

<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='powershell'><span class='line'><span class="n">del</span> <span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="n">em</span><span class="p">&gt;.</span><span class="n">xml</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="n">del</span> <span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="n">em</span><span class="p">&gt;.</span><span class="n">pickle</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="n">python</span> <span class="n">SmecoFeedObj</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">py</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="n">python</span> <span class="n">fetchlatest</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">py</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div></p>

<p>As you can see, the batch is very simple. It deletes the old files, scrapes the latest version and writes new files (SmecoFeedObj.py) and then updates the GeoCommons data set (fetchlatest.py).</p>

<p>The server is a Windows server so I set up a scheduled task (How to: <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/308569">XP</a>, <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Schedule-a-task">Vista</a>, <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/schedule-a-task">Windows 7</a>, <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc738106(WS.10).aspx">Server 2003</a>, <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc725745.aspx">Server 2008</a>). I set my task up to run once an hour so the latest data is scraped and pushed to GeoCommons hourly.</p>

<p>With the data set now created and being updated, it can be used to make maps in GeoCommons to visualize the changing data. I created two maps to demonstrate this. <a href="http://geocommons.com/maps/97820">The first</a>, using a filter, allows a user to filter the feed data to a time window of their choosing and map just the outage data for that time window.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://geocommons.com/maps/97820">second map</a>, shown below, uses GeoCommons animation capability to allow a user to "play through" the data based upon the publication date/time. A user can either drag the time slider manually or let it play automatically. They can also adjust the width of the slider to narrow/widen the time window. I've been told by GeoIQ that animation is under active improvement so I'm interested to see how it evolves. This was my first attempt at using it with my own data so I'm sure I'm not using it optimally. That said, I'm impressed with how easy it was to set up a time-based animation.</p>

<div style="text-align: center"><a href="http://geocommons.com/maps/97820"><img alt="" class="size-full wp-image-2043" height="278" src="http://geobabble.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/geocommons10.png" title="GeoCommons map animating power outage data" width="590" /></a><div style="text-align: center;font-size: 14px;">GeoCommons map animating power outage data<br/></div></div>


<p>All-in-all, it took me about 4 hours to go from data embedded in an HTML page to a working map animation. That really speaks to the power of the tools available today, from programming languages like Python and open standards like RSS to online tools like GeoCommons, as well as a host of others I didn't use for this work. It is becoming easier all the time to integrate and use spatial tools to exploit data from traditionally non-spatial sources and share the results widely. As traditional "GIS" fades into the background, the resulting fusion of more standard technologies is opening a wider world of possibilities.</p>

    <updated>2010-12-10T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.geomusings.com/2010/12/10/Ten-Second-Tidy</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Things have been a bit hectic the last few weeks and that's left little time for blogging. Quite a bit has happened so I thought I'd do a little round-up (if for no other reason than to clear my own head).</p>

<p>[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJa7P6dfmco]</p>

<p>In no particular order:</p>

<p><strong>Steve Coast to Microsoft</strong> (I told you it had been a while) - Firstly, congratulations to Steve (#sincerity).  Secondly, this clearly is the final proof that crowd-sourced data in general, and OpenStreetMaps (sic) in particular, <a href="http://geobabble.wordpress.com/2010/09/16/be-the-crowd/">has no real value when compared to "authoritative" data sources</a> (#sarcasm).</p>

<p><strong>Google Fusion Tables</strong> - The only real problem at this point is the size limitation but, otherwise, this will be a game-changer for storing and sharing data. In its current form, it's already fairly easy to push your data up and expose it through Google's APIs. It'll be interesting to see if it gets easier. Support for spatial queries hints at some analytical capability, too. Speaking of which...</p>

<p><strong>Analytics in GeoCommons</strong> - This is one to watch. They are debuting a new function each day <a href="http://blog.fortiusone.com/2010/12/06/the-12-analytics-of-christmas/">on their blog</a>. FortiusOne builds their platform API-first, UI-second so everything they are showing should be exposed through their APIs. This will be a huge step in moving cloud-based geospatial technology from the "bit-bucket" stage to having a more complete workflow on the cloud infrastructure.</p>

<p><strong>Arc2Earth Data Services and Arc2Cloud</strong> - Continuing the theme of building a complete workflow, <a href="http://www.arc2earth.com">Arc2Earth</a> is working on exposing a <a href="http://www.arc2earth.com/services/data-services/">complete range of Google geospatial services</a> to ArcGIS Desktop users. It's no secret that I'm a fan of Arc2Earth (and <a href="http://www.zekiah.com">my company</a> is a reseller), but this represents a big expansion of capability. Google's cloud infrastructure works differently that Amazon's and I think what <a href="http://beta.arc2cloud.com/">Arc2Earth is doing</a> is important because it will open up another channel for users and enable them to <a href="http://geobabble.wordpress.com/2010/07/26/clouds/">make choices based on their needs and requirements</a>.</p>

<p><strong>WeoGeo</strong> - <a href="http://www.weogeo.com">These guys</a> never sit still either. They've got some changes coming up that will greatly increase flexibility for managing spatial data on a cloud infrastructure. Taken together with the previous two entries on GeoCommons and Arc2Earth, I see a lot of innovation in cloud-based GIS really being driven by small, focused companies. This is not simply "push your server to an AMI and keep working." (Although that approach can have some utility.) Each of these companies is trying to figure out how to leverage the unique capabilities of cloud infrastructures to build new workflows and expand capability for users. And, it's important to note, they are making headway.</p>

<p><strong>WhereCampDC</strong> - Obviously, judging from the <a href="http://wherecampdc.org/">web site</a>, it's still in the early planning stages but I'm excited by the idea. This is exactly the kind of independent event that this area needs. I have always been baffled by the lack of such events in this area, especially given the level of geospatial activity around here.</p>

<p><strong>Google Earth 6</strong> - The <a href="http://www.google.com/earth/index.html">latest release</a> confirms that StreetView has yet to drive my street. For that I am happy.</p>

<p><strong>FOSS4G</strong> - The conference doesn't happen until next September and already the buzz is building. I have had people that I know have yet to touch an open-source GIS tool ask me what I know about "that <a href="http://foss4g.org/static/index.html">conference</a> I'm hearing about in Denver."</p>

<p><strong>Silverlight</strong> - I can't think of a technology in recent years that has given me more of a feeling of ambivalence. It has great capability and the Esri Silverlight API team has done good work building on it (this piece addresses Silverlight, not the Esri API). I think it'll continue to be a fine technology for intranet development but I'll leave it there. I don't expect my work with it to wind down anytime soon so I'll keep blogging it as I think it's perfectly possible to be productive with Silverlight within certain parameters. <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/10/30/rip-silverlight-on-the-web/">The whole episode regarding its future</a> (which was something of a tempest in a teapot, in reality) simply highlights the risks involved in relying on closed, proprietary technologies. This time, it was Silverlight, but make no mistake, the same risks are there with Flex/Flash (it just runs on more browser/OS combinations). Of course, there are risks with <em>any</em> technology choice but it's nice when those risks do not include "whim."</p>

<p>So that's it for my odds and ends. It's good to get them stuffed back into the couch. 2010 has been an interesting year. It almost feels like a year in which groundwork is being laid. It may just be me, but I have a feeling of anticipation similar to what I feel right before the first daffodils appear in Spring. It just feels like there's a good bit of pent-up energy and that a lot of new things are about to spring forth. It could be loads of fun.</p>
