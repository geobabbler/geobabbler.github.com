    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) has <a href="http://www.opengeospatial.org/pressroom/pressreleases/1756">published a draft GeoPackage specification for comment</a>. The GeoPackage specification attempts to create a non-proprietary means for packaging and exchanging all geospatial data in all its forms (vector, raster, and tiles). A couple of things that jump out at me:</p>

<ul>
<li>It calls out <a href="https://sqlite.org/">SQLite</a> as the reference implementation of a GeoPackage container</li>
<li>It calls out <a href="http://www.gaia-gis.it/gaia-sins/">SpatiaLite</a> 4 as the reference implementation of a vector feature store</li>
<li>It does not call out a reference implementation for rasters or tiles</li>
<li>It does not mention exchange of cartography.</li>
</ul>


<!--more-->


<p>Although the draft references the <a href="http://mapbox.com/developers/mbtiles/">MBTiles</a> specification and uses it as an example of a pure SQL method of storing tiles, it does not call out MBTiles as the chosen storage approach nor does it mention MBTiles as a reference implementation. The draft should not be read as "SpatiaLite + MBTiles."</p>

<div style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://www.publicdomainpictures.net/view-image.php?image=9097&picture=empty-cardboard-boxes"><img src="http://blog.geomusings.com/images/posts/boxes.png" /></a></div>


<p>I think, in 2013, anything that attempts to do what GeoPackage sets out to do should have some provision for cartography. I would prefer CSS-like approach (such as <a href="http://mapbox.com/tilemill/docs/manual/carto/">CartoCSS</a>) and will say so when I submit comments but I would suspect that future discussion of cartography, if any, will probably start with SLD. For now, tiles can fill the gap.</p>

<p>So comments are open, give it a look and tell OGC what you think.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Kevin Pomfret announced this morning that the <a href="http://www.spatiallaw.com/">Center for Spatial Law and Policy</a> will be hosting a workshop on geospatial data licensing.</p>

<p>Data licensing has always been an important issue but seems to be <a href="http://www.spatiallyadjusted.com/2012/12/26/this-isnt-the-road-network-you-are-looking-for/">moving to the forefront</a> as demand for quality spatial data grows. This workshop could prove to be timely. It is being held on 24 January 2013 in Tysons Corner, VA. Details can be found on the <a href="http://spatiallaw.blogspot.com/2012/12/geospatial-data-licensing-workshop.html">Spatial Law and Policy blog</a>.</p>

    <updated>2012-10-09T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.geomusings.com/2012/10/09/wilson-center-to-discuss-fcc-national-broadband-map</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One of the most compelling recent success stories for open-source geospatial tools in the Federal Government has been the <a href="http://www.fcc.gov/" target="_blank">Federal Communications Commission</a> (FCC) <a href="http://broadbandmap.gov/" target="_blank">National Broadband Map</a> initiative. It has been a very visible example of the stability, scalability, flexibility, and power of open-source geospatial tools.</p>

<p>The Woodrow Wilson Center will be hosting <a href="http://www.wilsoncenter.org/event/the-national-broadband-map-case-study-open-innovation-for-national-policy" target="_blank">a case study of National Broadband Map</a> on October 15th, 2012. The event's page also includes a link to the full paper (PDF), authored by <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=113470334" target="_blank">Zachary Bastian</a> of the Wilson Center and <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=10690378" target="_blank">Michael Byrne</a> of the FCC.</p>

<p><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2933" height="285" src="http://geobabble.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/nbm.png" title="nbm" width="640" /></p>

<p>The full paper, in my opinion, is recommended reading for anyone working with geospatial technologies in the government space. While the Broadband Map has rightfully garnered significant attention based upon its success, especially in terms of performance and scalability, the paper does a good job of reminding us that the map is not an end goal in itself, but a step toward the larger policy goal of expanding broadband access. The paper does an excellent job of illustrating how top-level policy goals were broken down into actionable parts that resulted in a concrete product such as the Broadband Map. In so doing, it walks us through the introduction and fostering of an open culture within the FCC that resulted not only in the Broadband Map but also in the development of open APIs and the availability of FCC tools as open-source projects themselves.</p>

<p>In its conclusions, the paper also makes compelling observations about the power of focused policy goals to drive the use of technology standing in stark contrast to generic overarching technical policies, such as the National Spatial Data Infrastructure (NSDI) which are disconnected from specific policy goals and achieve little traction.</p>

<p>If you are interested not only in geospatial technologies, but also the link between policy and technology implementation, and the cultural change that can be brought about by open-source technologies, you should consider attending the event at the Wilson Center on the 15th. While not a universal blueprint, the National Broadband Map makes a compelling case study.</p>
