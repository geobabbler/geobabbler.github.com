    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A few days ago, <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/MichaelShean" target="_blank">Michael Shean</a> of the <a href="http://www.mncppc.org/Commission_Home.html" target="_blank">Maryland-National Capital Parks and Planning Commission</a> (M-NCPPC) announced the availability of videos of 3-D terrain models created to support Planning Board activities in <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?hl=en&amp;cp=26&amp;gs_id=7&amp;xhr=t&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_qf.,cf.osb&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=638&amp;ion=1&amp;q=prince+george's+county&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=0x89b64bcdfea9f6a7:0x68f24b5f98fbb7fc,Prince+George's,+MD&amp;gl=us&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=1FzjT_H1Iq-t0AHasqikAw&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CJABELYD" target="_blank">Prince George's County, Maryland</a>. The videos have been made available via Google+ here: <a href="https://plus.google.com/105701421300090504528/posts" target="_blank">https://plus.google.com/105701421300090504528/posts</a>.</p>

<p>I followed up to inquire how the models were created. M-NCPPC analyst Chris Rotondo gave me the following information:</p>

<blockquote>"We build our 3D models in Google SketchUp, using measurements from the site plan images submitted by the developers. Their architectural elevation images are also the source for our model textures. The building model is then loaded into Google Earth Pro, where we complete the scene by adding simple models of adjacent 3D buildings (based on our LiDAR data) and landscaping. We use the video capture tool within Google Earth Pro to record a video showing all perspectives of the potential development, and the same video that is presented to the Prince George?s County Planning Board is the one available on our Google Plus website. We have also worked with ESRI ArcScene 10 to create more complex terrain models and perform 3D viewshed analysis."</blockquote>


<p>The use of <a href="http://www.google.com/earth/index.html" target="_blank">Google</a> (and/or <a href="http://sketchup.google.com/" target="_blank">Trimble</a>) and <a href="http://www.esri.com" target="_blank">Esri</a> tools in combination is a theme I see popping up more often in all levels of government. Many shops have long-standing Esri-based workflows but the power of Google for information dissemination and visualization is proving compelling. M-NCPPC does a good job here of making use of both to create good visualizations in support of their core mission. Additionally, I really like the use of a social media channel for dissemination and I'd love to learn more about what drove the decision to use <a href="http://plus.google.com" target="_blank">Google+</a> as opposed to some other channel. (I have no issues with Google+, but am curious what drivers affected the choice.)</p>

<p>This is a great example of the kind work many local governments are doing every day with traditional as well as not-so-traditional geospatial tools. Kudos to the Planning Department GIS staff at M-NCPPC.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A while back, I <a href="http://blog.geomusings.com/2011/09/26/free-maryland-gis-data-resources/">posted</a> about county-level GIS data available in the State of Maryland. I was very happy to see an <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/groupItem?view=&amp;gid=3300945&amp;item=ANET%3AS%3A84763573&amp;trk=NUS_RITM-title">announcement on LinkedIn</a> that Anne Arundel County, Maryland has rolled out a new <a href="http://www.aacounty.org/OIT/GIS/GISData.cfm">data download page</a> that makes their GIS data freely available.</p>

<div style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://geobabble.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/md_state_house_2011_12_14.jpg"><img alt="" height="614" src="http://geobabble.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/md_state_house_2011_12_14.jpg" title="md_state_house_2011_12_14" width="346" /></a><div style="text-align:center;font-size: 14px;">Anne Arundel County is home to Annapolis, the capital of Maryland and my favorite place on earth.<br/><br/></div></div>


<p>Kudos to <a href="http://twitter.com/Eric112200">Eric Wilson</a> and everyone else in the Anne Arundel County GIS group for making this happen. Here's hoping more follow suit.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It was with great interest that I read <a href="http://greatergreaterwashington.org/post/12041/regional-map-data-is-expensive/">this post last week about the cost of GIS data in the Washington, DC region</a>. Not only is the post itself informative but the comment discussion is also a worthy read.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.netstate.com/states/symb/flags/md_flag.htm"><img alt="" class="aligncenter" height="256" src="http://www.netstate.com/states/symb/flags/images/md_fi.gif" title="Maryland state flag" width="384" /></a></p>

<p>This did get me curious, however, as to which counties in my home state of Maryland make GIS data freely available. The approach I took to this was simple: I did what any average county resident would probably do and went to each county's web site looking for a link to a data download. If I didn't find something in a few clicks, I went to Google (search term: {county name} md gis). If there was nothing there, I moved on. With that, here are the counties I found which provide free, downloadable GIS data:</p>

<p><a href="http://ccgovernment.carr.org/ccg/mapserver4/gis/webpage/MapCatalogPage.html">Carroll County</a> (2000 Orthos only)</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ccgov.org/dept_planning/gis/avdata.cfm">Cecil County</a></p>

<p><a href="https://ww3.frederickcountymd.gov/gisdatazip/">Frederick County</a>  (requires registration)</p>

<p><a href="http://www.harfordcountymd.gov/GIS/Index.cfm">Harford County</a></p>

<p><a href="http://gis.howardcountymd.gov/mainsite/GeneralDataDownload.html">Howard County</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.stmarysmd.com/gis/">St. Mary's County</a></p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Additionally, data is available from the <a href="http://www.marylandgis.net/SHAdata/list.asp">Maryland State Highway Administration</a> (ESRI personal geodatabase)</p>

<p>I'm sure Maryland is not unique in the varying ways in which GIS data is distributed and the myriad ways local jurisdictions attempt cost recovery. These are difficult issues in the best of times and the current economic climate doesn't make them any easier.</p>

<p>I only surveyed data that was available from the counties (and Baltimore City) directly. I did not delve into the many municipalities. Basically, the list above should not be interpreted as comprehensive but I hope it is useful to some.</p>
