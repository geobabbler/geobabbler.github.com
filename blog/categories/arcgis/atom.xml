    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A while back, I posted about <a href="http://blog.geomusings.com/2011/11/15/fgeojson/">my desire to see GeoJSON supported as an output format from ArcGIS Server</a>. I found myself needing that capability so I recently completed, <a href="https://github.com/geobabbler/AGSOpenFormats">and posted to GitHub</a>, a first cut at a server object extension (SOE) for ArcGIS Server 10.1 that enables output of <a href="http://geojson.org/">GeoJSON</a> via an HTTP GET.</p>

<p>Using the SOE is fairly straightforward. If you download the code and build it (ensuring you have installed the ArcObjects SDK for .Net), you can simply move the project outputs to your target machine and use the ArcGIS Server manager to install the SOE. Once you log into the manager application, click "Site" at the top of the page and then "Extensions" on the left. Click "Add Extension" and browse to the .soe file. You should end up seeing something like this:</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"> <img src="http://blog.geomusings.com/images/posts/geojsonserver1.png" /></p>

<!--more-->


<p>After, that you can go back to "Services," choose a map service, select "Capabilities," and you should see "Open Data Formats" as a choice to select. At that point, you should be ready to go.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"> <img src="http://blog.geomusings.com/images/posts/geojsonserver2.png" /></p>

<p>That's all meat-and-potatoes configuration workflow that <a href="http://www.esri.com">Esri</a> has made very easy at 10.1. Once you've been through all of that, you should be able to go to your map service properties using a URL like this:</p>

<p>http://localhost/arcgis/rest/services/SampleWorldCities/MapServer</p>

<p>...and you should see be able to scroll to the bottom and see "GeoJSONServer" (which will change in a future version) as a supported extension.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"> <img src="http://blog.geomusings.com/images/posts/geojsonserver4.png" /></p>

<p>Following that link should take you to a page that shows "GeoJSON" as a supported operation. From there, you should be taken to a page that allows you to enter in a layer number (required) or a query (optional). The layer number is the layer's ordinal shown in the map service properties above. The query parameter can be a SQL WHERE clause that is valid for the layer in question (leaving off the word "WHERE"). This is consistent with how definition queries are handled elsewhere in the Esri REST API. At this point, GET and POST do the same thing though that may change in the future. You can use this form (which is generated by default) to test the SOE and get examples of valid URLs. For example, this URL returns GeoJSON for the continent of Asia from my sample map service:</p>

<p>http://localhost/arcgis/rest/services/SampleWorldCities/MapServer/exts/GeoJSONServer/GeoJSON?query=CONTINENT%3D%27Asia%27&amp;layer=1&amp;f=json</p>

<p>In the process of developing the SOE, I tested the outputs using <a href="http://geojsonlint.com/">geojsonlint.com</a> and the <a href="http://openlayers.org/dev/examples/vector-formats.html">OpenLayers vector format example</a> page (see the following screen shot).</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"> <img src="http://blog.geomusings.com/images/posts/geojsonserver5.png" /></p>

<p>A few nuts and bolts:</p>

<ol>
<li>I refactored my previous <a href="http://blog.geomusings.com/2012/08/24/togeojson-and-towkt-for-the-esri-fgdb-api/">extension methods for the File Geodatabase API</a> to work with ArcObjects for this SOE. The code is functional but I'd call the conversion about 75% complete. A close examination by an experienced ArcObjects developer may lead to some head-scratching as there are some artifacts from the FGDB API oriented code that I'll be cleaning up over the next couple of weeks.</li>
<li>The SOE is currently output-only and only supports attribute queries. I plan to work on the ability to pass in a GeoJSON geometry to do a spatial filter as well but my GeoJSON code currently only persists Esri geometries to GeoJSON but does not yet de-persist. For the sake of consistency, I don't want to mix JSON syntax, so I want to add in de-persistence before implementing spatial filters.</li>
<li>The SOE always transforms geometries to WGS84 for GeoJSON output. The GeoJSON spec doesn't specifically require this; it was just my call.</li>
<li>The SOE has been tested with ArcGIS Server 10.1 only. I don't know if the current code will present any issues with previous versions but I really have no plans to go back and test them. The actual GeoJSON generation shouldn't be much of an issue but I can't speak for the SOE interface itself. Forks are welcome.</li>
</ol>


<p>As can be seen, the code is still under active development but it works in its current configuration. It's actually performed pretty well on a very modest Amazon instance so I'm somewhat encouraged. I'll post some issues to GitHub as a nominal road map.</p>

<p>In a semi-related note, it looks like Marten Hogeweg of Esri is working on integrating GeoJSON support into Esri's portal server project, so users of that tool may want to hold on for that.</p>

At the time, I was hoping to dig into it fairly quickly but that didn't happen and I'm finally getting to it. Anyone who has followed this blog for a while knows that I have had <a href="http://blog.geomusings.com/2006/12/17/postgis-and-arcgis-9.1/">more</a> than a <a href="http://blog.geomusings.com/2007/07/10/consuming-georss-in-arcmap-with-inmemoryworkspacefactory/">passing</a> <a href="http://blog.geomusings.com/2012/10/03/cutting-tiles-for-arcgis-server-using-tilemill/">interest</a> in <a href="http://blog.geomusings.com/2010/06/02/importing-data-from-geocommons-into-arcmap/">integrating</a> new <a href="http://blog.geomusings.com/2011/03/02/announcing-weogeo-tools-for-arcgis/">data</a> <a href="http://blog.geomusings.com/2012/08/24/togeojson-and-towkt-for-the-esri-fgdb-api/">sources</a> <a href="http://blog.geomusings.com/2011/08/09/taking-a-look-at-pgmap/">with</a> <a href="http://blog.geomusings.com/2011/11/15/fgeojson/">ArcGIS</a> over the years. This comes from the fact that, as a technology geek, I am fascinated by all forms of technology and enjoy the process of integration and, as a consultant providing services to the Federal Government, most of my customers have standardized on Esri tools. Integrations such as GeoRSS, PostGIS, GeoCommons and GeoJSON have directly benefitted my customers for real-world applications so I continue look for ways to remove the barriers between them and the data they seek.</p>

<p>The GDAL/OGR plug-in caught my attention because it purports to add support for any format supported by GDAL and OGR, similar to the way <a href="http://qgis.org">QGIS</a> leverages them for a wide variety of format support. To get going with it, I downloaded the source and built it in Visual Studio 2010. I only ran into a couple of minor issues. First, a had previously installed the Windows build of OGR on my machine using the <a href="http://www.gisinternals.com/sdk/PackageList.aspx?file=release-1600-gdal-1-9-2-mapserver-6-2-0.zip">distribution from GIS Internals</a>. The project as it came down from GitHub couldn't find the OGR and OSR bindings for C#, so I had to resolve that trivial issue. Next, the plug-in was built for use in ArcGIS 10.1 but I was using 10.0. Because some new interfaces were introduced, the <a href="https://github.com/RBURHUM/arcgis-ogr/blob/master/src/OGRPlugin/OGRPlugin/ogrplugin_utils.cs">current code</a> contains a declaration of  type ISpatialReferenceFactory4, which is a 10.1 interface. I needed to change that to ISpatialReferenceFactory3 to make it work with 10.0. That has been the only change I have needed to make so far to account for the version differences. I plan to add a compiler directive in my fork of the project to account for that and submit it back once I can test it.</p>

<p>As I said before, I previously had installed GDAL/OGR so it was already on my machine and my GDAL_DATA environment variable was set. When I built the plug-in and attempted to use it in ArcMap, it threw an error when I tried adding a GeoJSON layer (also with SpatiaLite) that it could not find my gcs.csv file, which is in my GDAL_DATA location. With a little investigation, I found that the code was resetting that variable at runtime to point to the location of the plug-in binary. I copied the files there and it worked well from then on. I'll probably try to add a way to check for the existence of that variable before setting it. None of these issues were major and I think they were reasonable design choices up front so I am not concerned by them.</p>

<p>At that point, I was able to quickly add GeoJSON and SpatiaLite layers to my data frame in ArcMap. This is pretty exciting to me since the ability to support a wide range of data types was a long-standing goal of zigGIS and I'm glad that Ragi has conquered that with this work.</p>

<p>Because the layers are added using a plug-in workspace, they are full read-only citizens inside ArcGIS. For example, I was able to wire up a couple of models using ModelBuilder and execute clips (clipping a GeoJSON layer with a SpatiaLite layer) and buffers and simple tests. I'm really not a huge ModelBuilder user but I thought it would be a good way to test things out.</p>

<div style="text-align:center;font-size: 14px;">Model to test a simple buffer<br/><br/></div></div>


<p>The model above produced a 50-foot buffer around Amtrak rail lines from NTAD 2012 in GeoJSON format. The resultant buffer was written to a file geodatabase. As you can see from the image below, it worked like a charm.</p>

<div style="text-align:center;font-size: 14px;">Results of the buffer model.<br/><br/></div></div>


<p>I achieved similar success with a clip operation so I'm sufficiently confident in trying to package the plug-in up and put it in the hands of some of the analysts with whom I work. All-in-all, the plug-in is a nice piece of work. It's still not fully baked but it's a very solid start and deserves a closer look if you're looking to expand the reach of your ArcGIS investment.</p>
