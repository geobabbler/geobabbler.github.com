    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>On what seems to be turning into <a href="http://www.gaia-gis.it/gaia-sins/" target="_blank">SpatiaLite</a> Monday, Sandro Furieri also announced on the <a href="https://groups.google.com/group/spatialite-users?pli=1" target="_blank">SpatiaLite Google Group</a> the availability of a stable version of SpatiaLite for Android.</p>

<p>I am happy to see that this version was developed and contributed back by the <a href="http://www.agc.army.mil/" target="_blank">US Army Geospatial Center</a>. The fact that they contributed back to the project under a standard open-source license is a nice step from a DoD organization.</p>

<p>The message is quoted below:</p>

<blockquote>
Hi List,

I'm really proud to announce you all that finally a rock solid stable and really easy-to-be-deployed binary porting of SpatiaLite for the Android platform is now available for download [1].

[1] <a href="https://www.gaia-gis.it/fossil/libspatialite/wiki?name=splite-android" target="_blank">https://www.gaia-gis.it/fossil/libspatialite/wiki?name=splite-android</a>

Many thanks to the U.S. Army Geospatial Center [2] who very generously contributed this highly appreciated and really useful resource under a genuine free software license (LGPLv3).

[2] <a href="http://www.agc.army.mil/" target="_blank">http://www.agc.army.mil/</a>

A detailed tutorial [3] explaining how-to deploy and use SpatiaLite on Android platforms has been kindly contributed by Andrea Antonello, who spent many long hours during the last week while performing a thorough testing of SpatiaLite-Android, then deciding to publicly share his experiences with the SpatiaLite community. Feel absolutely free to pay a beer to Andrea; he'll surely appreciate ;-)

    <id>http://blog.geomusings.com/2012/11/26/spatialite-4-0-released</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It looks like it was a busy weekend for Sandro Furieri and the rest of the <a href="https://www.gaia-gis.it/fossil/libspatialite/index" target="_blank">SpatiaLite</a> team as version 4.0 was announced on Sunday. There are a number of changes, so it's best to <a href="https://www.gaia-gis.it/fossil/libspatialite/wiki?name=switching-to-4.0" target="_blank">catch up on them</a> before switching over.</p>

<div style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.manningltg.com/fixture_show.php?f_id=GCQ-164&amp;f_desc=Spatialite%20(Quartz%20Halogen)"><img alt="" height="300" src="http://www.manningltg.com/product_imgs/web/GCQ-164_1.jpg" title="Not this SpatiaLite" width="490" /></a><div style="text-align: center;font-size: 14px;">Not this SpatiaLite</div></div>


<p>I have a couple of Federal customers that are integrating SpatiaLite into their workflows so I'll need to take a day or so to assess impacts any impacts there. Looks like the perfect way to slide back into work after a long weekend.</p>

    <id>http://blog.geomusings.com/2012/08/24/togeojson-and-towkt-for-the-esri-fgdb-api</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In support of some of our ongoing <a href="http://www.zekiah.com/index.php?q=blog/topics/pim" target="_blank">PIM</a> work, we've been integrating the <a href="http://www.esri.com" target="_blank">Esri</a> <a href="http://resources.arcgis.com/content/geodatabases/10.0/file-gdb-api" target="_blank">File Geodatabase (FGDB) API</a> into some tools. Without going into a level of detail that would hijack this post, one of the many functions performed by some of the tools is to validate physical spatial databases against established data models to analyze compliance and identify differences. These databases may be in Esri or non-Esri formats and we have traditionally handled Esri geodatabases through ArcObjects since it provides a relatively uniform interface across the various flavors of geodatabase.</p>

<p><img alt="" style="text-align: center;" height="300" src="http://geobabble.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/fileapi2.png" title="FGDB API" width="287" /></p>

<p>Of course, ArcObjects requires an ArcGIS license of some sort and we are finding out that this is not always available to users in the field under many situations so the FGDB API gets past that for file geodatabases, at least. <!--more--></p>

<p>Since the PIM is really a configuration management system for spatial data models, the tools need to support a wide variety of scenarios, including data migration between platforms, versions, approved user-defined implementations, etc. in a manner that's compliant with the data model being managed. As a result, some ETL-like tools are built into the workflows, although ETL is not a primary focus of the PIM.</p>

<p>Since the PIM tools are written in .NET, I built a couple of extension methods to assist with some of the workflows in the existing tools. They enable outbound support for GeoJSON and WKT. The GeoJSON methods work on RowCollection, Row, and ShapeBuffer objects to create FeatureCollection, Feature, and Geometry types respectively. In practice, they'd be used something like this example from a very simple ASP.NET MVC sample application:</p>

<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span><span class='line'><span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">result</span> <span class="k">as</span> <span class="n">ActionResult</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div></p>

<p>The WKT method only works on ShapeBuffer objects to export geometries. The code for the extension methods themselves can be found on <a href="https://github.com/geobabbler/FgdbExtensions" target="_blank">GitHub here</a>. It includes a five-minutes-or-less MVC sample from which the above code was lifted. I know I'll be doing some cleanup on the GeoJSON in the near future and I'll probably add support for EWKT to smooth our interactions with <a href="http://postgis.refractions.net/" target="_blank">PostGIS</a> and <a href="http://www.gaia-gis.it/gaia-sins/" target="_blank">SpatiaLite</a> and may also add support for WKB.</p>

<p>As I said, I developed these to support workflows in existing applications. If you're looking to just perform data conversion or ETL, you should just use <a href="http://www.gdal.org/ogr/" target="_blank">OGR</a> or <a href="http://www.safe.com/" target="_blank">FME</a>.</p>

    <link href="http://blog.geomusings.com/2012/06/07/breaking-radio-silence/"/>
    <updated>2012-06-07T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.geomusings.com/2012/06/07/breaking-radio-silence</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Things have been kind of quiet on the blog lately due to things being busy at work. I call that a good problem to have. Since the beginning of the year, I've written a a lot of proposals for a mixture of potential customers. Interestingly, I'm seeing a lot more call for "GIS Analyst" work. One trend I've noticed, at least in the Federal sector, is that the time between proposal due dates and award announcements seems to be lengthening. That may be an indication of the ongoing flux in funding and organizations try to figure out how to fund their requirements. It will be interesting to see how it shakes out. Of course, it's good that the opportunities are there in the first place.</p>

<p><a href="http://geobabble.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/microphone.jpg"><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2664" height="413" src="http://geobabble.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/microphone.jpg" title="microphone" width="413" /></a></p>

<p>One the technical side of things, I've been involved in a smattering of things that's made it hard to roll up one good post. I'm pretty heavily involved in the PIM efforts that my colleague, Barry Schimpf, <a href="http://www.zekiah.com/index.php?q=blog/topics/pim" target="_blank">has been blogging about</a> over on the <a href="http://www.zekiah.com" target="_blank">Zekiah</a> blog. <!--more--> Historically, the PIM data structures have been housed in Microsoft SQL Server, but we've been working on porting it to other platforms to provide options to end users. We've done an initial port to <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/" target="_blank">PostgreSQL</a> but we've been spending most of our time on a <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/" target="_blank">SQLite</a>/<a href="http://www.gaia-gis.it/gaia-sins/" target="_blank">SpatiaLite</a> version. This has taken two forms. First is the port of the PIM structure itself to SQLite to make it easier to provide some of the PIM services such as profiling, version-to-version migrations, dataset generation, and validation in remote, field-based settings. Second is the generation/validation of physical implementations in SpatiaLite. This is being done for a customer who is expecting to do field data collection using SpatiaLite and these services will be helpful in enhancing data quality at the point of collection. Additionally, the SpatiaLite aspect of this work has had me living within <a href="http://qgis.org/" target="_blank">QGIS</a> lately.</p>

<p>Another thing I've been experimenting with is the use of <a href="http://nodejs.org/" target="_blank">Node.js</a> for real-time data processing. Our long-standing work in the situational awareness realm has had us working with real-time data feeds for a long time. I'm interested in the possibility of using Node to tackle some of the feed collection tasks. I've used an event-driven approach for such tasks in the past so that aspect of Node is quite familiar to me but the use of Javascript, its ease of deployment and potential scalability are intriguing to me. I'm coming late to the party with Node, primarily due to my rustiness with Javascript, but I'm liking what I'm seeing so far.</p>

<p>Beyond those major things, I've had the opportunity to start working with <a href="http://postgis.org/" target="_blank">PostGIS</a> 2.0 and play more with <a href="http://leaflet.cloudmade.com/" target="_blank">Leaflet</a> and <a href="http://mapbox.com/" target="_blank">MapBox</a>. On the development side of things, these efforts have had be jumping back and forth a lot between C#, Javascript and a little bit of Python, as well as between Windows and Linux, depending on the task.</p>

<p>You'll notice that I didn't mention any <a href="http://www.esri.com" target="_blank">Esri</a> tools. That's primarily because recent demand from my customers has led me to a different tool set. I expect that to level out somewhat in the near future since many of the outstanding proposals I mentioned have a strong Esri flavor. As always, having a broad toolbox can be an asset in consulting. I'll be skipping San Diego again this year. I'm finding that Esri's Federal Conference in DC is of such increasing quality each year that it fulfills my needs for Esri-related information. That's really okay with me because I'd rather spend as much of the summer with my family as possible. So it's not so much a down-vote of Esri as my taking advantage of options that fit into my life better.</p>

<p>I hope to be able blog in more detail about some of these efforts as I get farther along with them. Times like this make it exciting to work in the geospatial field. There's a lot of churn in the market right now with regard to tools and technologies. I'm not sure I can perceive any meaningful gap between the capabilities of open-source and proprietary geospatial tools anymore. As a result, there are a lot of options to choose from for building robust systems and applications. It looks to be a fun summer.</p>

    <id>http://blog.geomusings.com/2012/04/02/2011-tiger-boundary-files-in-spatialite-format</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Over on the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/spatialite-users">SpatiaLite Google Group</a>, <a href="http://www.stineconsulting.com/">Stine Consulting</a> announced the availability of <a href="http://www.stineconsulting.com/GIS%20Resources.php">2011 TIGER Boundary files</a> in <a href="http://www.gaia-gis.it/gaia-sins/">SpatiaLite</a> format.</p>

<p>Despite initial enthusiasm, mainstream uptake of SpatiaLite has been slow but I think that's about to change. Large organizations, such as the US Army, are showing a much more serious interest in SpatiaLite as they expand their use of mobile and hand-held platforms.</p>

<p>I expect that increased availability of data in native SpatiaLite databases will also help adoption. So if you need US boundaries data, check out this offering from Stine Consulting. And, if you're looking for more data for use in SpatiaLite, don't forget that you can download any dataset available on <a href="http://www.geocommons.com">GeoCommons</a> as a SpatiaLite database.</p>
