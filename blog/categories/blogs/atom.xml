    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I am seeing a bit of a bump in traffic from the "<a href="http://www.onlineengineeringdegree.org/50-best-blogs-for-geography-geeks">50 Best Blogs for Geography Geeks</a>" list that hit the interwebs yesterday. I don't usually pay much attention to such lists but I do recognize that they can be useful "one-stop" resources for people who are just getting started with geospatial tools. That said, this list caught my attention more for some of the blogs that were not included than for those that were.</p>

<p>If you are here because my blog was listed there (the list was also blogged by <a href="http://mapperz.blogspot.com/2010/09/50-best-blogs-for-geography-geeks.html">Mapperz</a>), here are a few notable geospatially-oriented blogs that I was surprised to find omitted from that list. These are blogs I consider resources and inspirations for my work/explorations/musings. I strongly recommend checking them out. They are listed in no particular order.</p>

<p>The topics covered by these blogs run the gamut and titles can be deceiving so I suggest digging into each one. Search the archives of each and you can find some good information. Enjoy!</p>
