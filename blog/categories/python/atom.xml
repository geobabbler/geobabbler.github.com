    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Just a quick note to tidy up some loose ends related to recent posts...</p>

<p>First, regarding the post "<a href="http://blog.geomusings.com/2013/03/17/a-lazyweb-compendium-of-python-resources-for-beginners/">A #LazyWeb Compendium of Python Resources for Beginners</a>," the University of South Florida PyBulls Python interest group, as promised, compiled a list of Python resources and posted it <a href="https://github.com/PyBulls/learning-resources">on their GitHub page</a>. Thanks to them for their quick response.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"> <img src="http://img.ehowcdn.com/article-new/ehow/images/a06/kv/li/proper-cutting-down-tree-chainsaw-800x800.jpg" /></p>

<p>Second, following up on the post "<a href="http://blog.geomusings.com/2013/03/20/the-best-thing-i-saw-at-tugis-2013/">The Best Thing I Saw at TUGIS 2013</a>," the data and workbooks for Dr. Arthur Lembo's introduction to open-source GIS have been made available. The data <a href="https://github.com/esrgc/qgistraining">can be found on GitHub</a> and the workbooks can be found on the <a href="http://www.esrgc.org/training/">Eastern Shore Regional GIS Cooperative web site</a>. Many thanks for contributing these resources.</p>

<p>These items are embedded in the comments for their respective posts but I thought it would be useful to call them out more prominently.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A friend who is in the midst of a career change and moving into the GIS world asked me for some pointers to resources for getting started with Python. I threw the question out to Twitter (with a similar variation also posted to Google+):</p>

    <link href="http://blog.geomusings.com/2012/11/09/personal-geospatial-workflows/"/>
    <updated>2012-11-09T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.geomusings.com/2012/11/09/personal-geospatial-workflows</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I've had a couple of people ask me recently about the geospatial tools I use. Year-over-year, that answer changes but here's how I answer that right now:</p>

<p>As a Federal contractor, I spend a lot of time working with the <a href="http://www.esri.com" target="_blank">Esri</a> stack during my work day. A few years ago, I added a few open-source geospatial tools into my tool set and, since then, have also done a respectable amount to consulting work them as well. The balance between the two varies over time, depending on the requirements of individual customers and projects. Lately, commercial customers have seemed much more interested in open-source tools while my government customers are sticking with Esri. Since those observations are based on the the extremely heavy filter of my own recent experience, I'd be hesitant to draw any larger conclusions from them.</p>

<p><img alt="" height="264" src="http://blog.geomusings.com/images/posts/duct-tape.jpg" title="Duct Tape" width="300" /></p>

<p>I've always believed that proficiency with a wide range of tools makes me a better consultant and integrator, so I am always exploring and trying new things. With those commercial customers, and in my own personal side projects, my recent workflows have gelled around a core set of tools, both commercial and open-source: <!--more--></p>

<p><a href="http://www.postgis.org" target="_blank">PostGIS</a> - I am very comfortable with SQL and tend to use <a href="http://www.postgresql.org" target="_blank">PostgreSQL</a> and PostGIS for a lot of my vector data processing. Lately, this has mainly involved joining up geometries with attributes and doing aggregations and similar things. For example, the vector data in this <a href="http://geobabbler.github.com/mdq62012.html" target="_blank">map of the county-level Maryland Question 6 results</a> was processed in PostGIS. Very simply, I have a baseline table of the counties of Maryland which I will use to create new data sets. In this case, I imported a CSV of the election results, created a view that joined up the data and then selected the view into a new table. This is workflow is much easier with PostGIS 2.x thanks to the <a href="http://blog.opengeo.org/2012/03/06/postgis-2-0-new-features-typmod/" target="_blank">use of typmod</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://qgis.org" target="_blank">QGIS</a> - In the case of the map mentioned above, the data set is ultimately going to be static so it makes sense to serve it as static content, rather than bringing a heavyweight geospatial server such as <a href="http://www.esri.com/software/arcgis/arcgisserver/" target="_blank">ArcGIS</a> or <a href="http://geoserver.org/display/GEOS/Welcome" target="_blank">GeoServer</a> into the mix. In these cases, I lean toward <a href="http://geojson.org/" target="_blank">GeoJSON</a>. QGIS makes it very easy to export any vector layer out to GeoJSON so it's become my go-to tool for that. QGIS also has great analytical tools and I consider it a complete functional match for ArcMap but, having said that, I'm actually very comfortable with the spatial SQL functions in PostGIS so I end up doing most of my analytical work there.</p>

<p><a href="http://leafletjs.com/" target="_blank">Leaflet</a>/<a href="http://www.openlayers.org/" target="_blank">OpenLayers</a> - Most of the web maps I'm doing are single-use and pretty straightforward. When that's the case, I prefer to use Leaflet as it's a pretty lightweight library. That said, I keep OpenLayers in the mix if the GIS-like requirements get a little more complex. OpenLayers does more "out of the box" than Leaflet but Leaflet is trimmer so it really depends on the use case.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.arc2earth.com/" target="_blank">Arc2Earth</a>/<a href="http://mapbox.com/tilemill/" target="_blank">TileMill </a>- Arc2Earth is a commercial extension to ArcGIS and I lean on it to make tiles, although it does a lot more than that. I also use TileMill for this purpose but it really depends on where my cartography resides. There's a lot of good cartography locked up in MXDs and Arc2Earth is just a great way to capitalize on that. It's also nice that Arc2Earth works in ArcMap, eliminating the need for a license of Server.  If I'm building my cartography from scratch, which is not really my strong suit, I'll lean toward TileMill because it more easily connects directly to PostGIS, which is where my data tends to reside if I have my druthers. Again, it depends on the use case.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.python.org/" target="_blank">Python</a>/Javascript - I'm doing a lot more work in Python these days. It's become the <em>lingua franca</em> of GIS development in my book. Additionally, the capabilities of Javascript for web maps is evolving at a stunning pace. I can't see being productive in the long term in the geospatial field without proficiency in these two languages.</p>

<p>So these are the tools that I'm using most often these days as part of my personal workflows. The stable of tools that I use evolves over time, as should be evident if you peruse this blog. In general, I'm finding it very easy to be productive with these tools right now.</p>

    <link href="http://blog.geomusings.com/2012/10/03/cutting-tiles-for-arcgis-server-using-tilemill/"/>
    <updated>2012-10-03T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.geomusings.com/2012/10/03/cutting-tiles-for-arcgis-server-using-tilemill</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There's been a lot of talk about <a href="http://mapbox.com/tilemill/" target="_blank">TileMill</a> and <a href="http://mapbox.com/tilemill/docs/manual/carto/" target="_blank">CartoCSS</a> lately, with good cause. TileMill makes it very easy generate beautiful map tiles using the <a href="http://mapnik.org/" target="_blank">Mapnik</a> engine and CartoCSS provides a familiar method to author the cartographic representation of spatial data. <a href="http://mapbrief.com/2012/09/27/gis-cartography-the-latest-best-opportunity-to-bridge-the-chasm/" target="_blank">As Brian Timoney points out</a>, CartoCSS has the added bonus of making best practices shareable via copy-and-paste.</p>




<p>Naturally, the best way to take advantage of TileMill is to export your tiles to <a href="https://github.com/mapbox/mbtiles-spec" target="_blank">MBTiles</a> and use <a href="http://mapbox.com/" target="_blank">MapBox</a> hosting. If that's not an option, you can pretty easily self-host with <a href="https://github.com/mapbox/tilestream" target="_blank">TileStream</a>. That said, there are some organizations that, due to larger GIS workflows, IT policies, and a host of other legitimate reasons, need or choose to use <a href="http://www.esri.com" target="_blank">ArcGIS Server</a> to do map hosting. For those organizations, TileMill is still an option to create attractive basemaps, within certain constraints.</p>


<p><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2911" height="295" src="http://geobabble.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/tilemill_screen.png" title="tilemill_screen" width="640" /></p>

<p>So I set out to see if I could bridge the gap between the two. Two blog posts pointed the way. A while back, <a href="http://www.weogeo.com/blog/Create_WeoGeo_Tilepack_from_MBTiles_SQLite_database_with_mbutil.html" target="_blank">Dan Dye blogged about how he had forked mb-util</a> and added support for exporting WeoGeo tilepacks from MBTiles. Also, a co-worker of mine, Eric Mahaffey, had blogged some time ago about <a href="http://www.zekiah.com/index.php?q=blog/2011/08/03/using-arc2earth-tile-caching-across-air-gapped-networks" target="_blank">how to use Arc2Earth to manage tile caches across air-gapped networks</a>. Using these posts for guidance, I was pretty sure I had all the pieces I needed. <!--more--></p>

<p>First, I decided to fork Dan's code (I love GitHub) and add support for exporting ArcGIS tiles. Essentially, I followed Dan's pattern and added a choice for an ArcGIS schema as a command-line option. My forked version <a href="https://github.com/geobabbler/mbutil" target="_blank">can be found on GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>I then fired up TileMill (0.10.0 for Windows) and created some tiles at zoom levels 4 through 8 using the "Control Room" sample that comes with TileMill. I chose this for two reasons: First, I am not very good at cartography and this sample looks attractive and distinct from the generic ArcGIS sample I used. Second, it's very well-known to TileMill users so it worked well for this demo. I won't go into how I created the tiles as this post is not intended to be a TileMill tutorial.</p>

<p>Once I had exported the tiles to an MBTiles file, I ran the updated mb-util Python utility to export the tiles in an ArcGIS structure. The command-line usage is shown below. One note: I did not generate the "level" folders in accordance with ArcGIS convention. If you are familiar with ArcGIS, you know that the level numbers are relative so that, if your service only contains levels 3, 4 , and 5, the will be levels L00, L01, L02 respectively. Instead, the utility names them according to their original TMS levels (L03, L04, L05 in this case). So, you may need to rename your level folders when you rehost to ArcGIS Server but this should entail a maximum of 19 manual edits, which seemed like a reasonable compromise.</p>

<p><a href="http://geobabble.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/mbutil_cmd.png"><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2897" height="311" src="http://geobabble.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/mbutil_cmd.png" title="mb-util usage" width="640" /></a></p>

<p>So mb-util created the "_alllayers" folder and its child file system for us. Because I'm not creating a conf.xml yet, I can create it by hand or use ArcGIS to create some dummy tiles with a configuration. Once that's done, we are simply engaged in a file copy  operation (picking up at step 4 of Eric's post). For this demo, I created an actual map using one of the ArcGIS samples so that it would be apparent that the operation worked. In practice, I wouldn't go to that much trouble up front. The image below shows the map service using the original tiles.</p>

<div style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://geobabble.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/arc_tilemill1.png"><img alt="" class="size-full wp-image-2901" height="370" src="http://geobabble.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/arc_tilemill1.png" title="ArcGIS map service before TileMill tiles" width="640" /></a> <div style="text-align: center;font-size: 14px;">ArcGIS map service as created from the original MXD.</div></div>


<p>After I copied the tiles from TileMill into the correct location, I was able to refresh the window and see the boundary between the original tiles and the those from TileMill. Again, this was just for demo purposes. In practice, the whole cache would be from TileMill. The image below shows the updated cache, displayed using the ArcGIS Javascript API.</p>

<div style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://geobabble.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/arc_tilemill2.png"><img alt="" class="size-full wp-image-2902" height="370" src="http://geobabble.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/arc_tilemill2.png" title="ArcGIS map service after TileMill tiles" width="640" /></a> <div style="text-align: center;font-size: 14px;">ArcGIS map service showing tiles from TileMill.</div></div>


<p>I apologize for screenshots but my EDN license precludes making my ArcGIS Server public for a live demo.</p>

<p>So, it's perfectly possible to create nice basemaps using TileMill for use in ArcGIS server, provided you adhere to two constraints: 1) You use Web Mercator for your spatial reference and 2) You make sure your ArcGIS cache is the "exploded" variety.</p>

<p>Why would you do this? It is certainly possible to build great cartographic representations in ArcGIS but those representations are locked away in ArcGIS map documents, styles, layer packages and such; all of which are some proprietary binary format such as persisted COM objects. While this may not be the worst thing in the world, CartoCSS, being a text format, more easily lends itself to configuration control. Organizations that want to maintain configuration control over map templates and such can take advantage of standard tools such as git or SVN to do so. I have found that organizations with strict IT policies are also exactly the same kinds of organizations that to maintain control over content and styling so this is actually a surprisingly important factor.</p>

<p>I'll probably play with this more as time and customer demand allow, but it's good to know this option is available for providing flexibility with ArcGIS Server.</p>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[Using Dynamic Non-Spatial Data In GeoCommons]]></title>
    <link href="http://blog.geomusings.com/2011/09/07/using-dynamic-non-spatial-data-in-geocommons/"/>
    <updated>2011-09-07T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.geomusings.com/2011/09/07/using-dynamic-non-spatial-data-in-geocommons</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In <a href="http://blog.geomusings.com/2011/08/30/prying-data-open/">my previous post</a>, I described how I used a Python script to scrape power outage information from a local web site and convert it into an RSS feed. In this post, I'll show how I used GeoCommons to visualize the changing information over time.</p>

<p>The process starts by creating a data set in GeoCommmons based on a URL link to the feed created in the previous post. The general process for doing that can be found <a href="http://geocommons.com/help/User_Manual#Add-a-URL-Link-from-the-web">here</a> in the GeoCommons documentation.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>My feed is not a GeoRSS feed so it has no location data of its own for GeoCommons to work with. During the upload process, I reached this screen, which starts the process of helping to attach location to my data.</p>

<p><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2037" height="388" src="http://geobabble.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/geocommons4.png" title="Geolocating data in GeoCommons" width="590" /></p>

<p>The feed summarizes power outage by ZIP code so I chose "Join with a boundary dataset" so that I could join it with ZIP code boundaries I had previously uploaded.</p>

<p>I selected the attribute in my feed (title) that was to be used to join with a corresponding attribute in the boundary data set (Zip) as shown below.</p>

<p><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2038" height="345" src="http://geobabble.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/geocommons6.png" title="GeoCommons6" width="590" /></p>

<p>You'll notice that the success message indicates three features were matched. This is true for this version of the feed because ZIP codes with zero power outages are not reported. The join, however, updates itself as the feed updates so more or less polygons may appear in the current version, depending upon feed content.</p>

<p>After reviewing my data and providing some basic metadata, GeoCommons performed the join and my data set was ready to go.</p>

<p><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2041" height="443" src="http://geobabble.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/geocommons9.png" title="Completed data set" width="554" /></p>

<p>In the image above, you'll notice a link labeled "fetch latest." That link, which is formatted as "http://geocommons.com/overlays/{overlayid}/fetch," can be used to manually get the latest version of the feed, which is stored by GeoCommons. Essentially, GeoCommons stores the state of each feature in the data set as the feed is fetched so you build a "version history" your data. As long as you have a date/time attribute, you can use GeoCommons to visualize the changes over time.</p>

<p>In addition to the Python code from previous post, I also used a variant on the script found at <a href="http://www.voidspace.org.uk/python/articles/authentication.shtml">http://www.voidspace.org.uk/python/articles/authentication.shtml</a>. The fetching capability requires authentication so I modified the script to call the "fetch" URL using my GeoCommons user name and password. The script may be overkill but work perfectly without any changes.</p>

<p>On the server, I wrote a four-line batch file to act as a driver for the whole process. This batch file is what is called by a scheduled task in Windows.</p>

<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='powershell'><span class='line'><span class="n">del</span> <span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="n">em</span><span class="p">&gt;.</span><span class="n">xml</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="n">del</span> <span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="n">em</span><span class="p">&gt;.</span><span class="n">pickle</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="n">python</span> <span class="n">SmecoFeedObj</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">py</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="n">python</span> <span class="n">fetchlatest</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">py</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div></p>

<p>As you can see, the batch is very simple. It deletes the old files, scrapes the latest version and writes new files (SmecoFeedObj.py) and then updates the GeoCommons data set (fetchlatest.py).</p>

<p>The server is a Windows server so I set up a scheduled task (How to: <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/308569">XP</a>, <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Schedule-a-task">Vista</a>, <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/schedule-a-task">Windows 7</a>, <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc738106(WS.10).aspx">Server 2003</a>, <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc725745.aspx">Server 2008</a>). I set my task up to run once an hour so the latest data is scraped and pushed to GeoCommons hourly.</p>

<p>With the data set now created and being updated, it can be used to make maps in GeoCommons to visualize the changing data. I created two maps to demonstrate this. <a href="http://geocommons.com/maps/97820">The first</a>, using a filter, allows a user to filter the feed data to a time window of their choosing and map just the outage data for that time window.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://geocommons.com/maps/97820">second map</a>, shown below, uses GeoCommons animation capability to allow a user to "play through" the data based upon the publication date/time. A user can either drag the time slider manually or let it play automatically. They can also adjust the width of the slider to narrow/widen the time window. I've been told by GeoIQ that animation is under active improvement so I'm interested to see how it evolves. This was my first attempt at using it with my own data so I'm sure I'm not using it optimally. That said, I'm impressed with how easy it was to set up a time-based animation.</p>

<div style="text-align: center"><a href="http://geocommons.com/maps/97820"><img alt="" class="size-full wp-image-2043" height="278" src="http://geobabble.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/geocommons10.png" title="GeoCommons map animating power outage data" width="590" /></a><div style="text-align: center;font-size: 14px;">GeoCommons map animating power outage data<br/></div></div>


<p>All-in-all, it took me about 4 hours to go from data embedded in an HTML page to a working map animation. That really speaks to the power of the tools available today, from programming languages like Python and open standards like RSS to online tools like GeoCommons, as well as a host of others I didn't use for this work. It is becoming easier all the time to integrate and use spatial tools to exploit data from traditionally non-spatial sources and share the results widely. As traditional "GIS" fades into the background, the resulting fusion of more standard technologies is opening a wider world of possibilities.</p>
