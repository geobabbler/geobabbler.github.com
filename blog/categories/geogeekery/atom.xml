    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I just learned from <a href="http://twitter.com/wonderchook">Kate Chapman</a> that the date for <a href="http://wherecampdc.org/">WhereCampDC</a> has been set. It will be Saturday, June 11th. If you are interested in attending, you can register through EventBrite <a href="http://wherecampdc.eventbrite.com/">here</a>. Move fast because it'll probably fill up quickly!</p>

<p>Despite all the of geospatial activity in this region, there has been a dearth of conference activity. The <a href="http://www.esri.com/events/feduc/index.html">Esri FedUC</a> has been the only game in town for years so WhereCampDC is a welcome addition to the scene. Also, the very structured conference environment around here could stand a little injection of "un" into its veins. :)</p>

<p>Oh yeah, there'll be lightning talks on the 10th, too!</p>

<p>See you there!</p>
