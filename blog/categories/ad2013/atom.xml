    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As we enter the final hours of 2013, I wanted to take the chance to thank everyone who stopped by, and continues to stop by, this blog. I appreciate your readership, comments, and feedback. Even after 7 years, I am still humbled by the fact that so many read this blog each year. I decided to take a look at the top ten posts from this year, according to Google Analytics.</p>

<p>When I took a look at the list above, I realized that I have been much more focused on data than I have in past years. I think I kept a development/integration flavor but the focus on data was quite noticeable in retrospect. Though I have been actively coding all year, I notice that I did not have as many code-focused posts, which is something of a departure from previous years. 2014 is already shaping up to be a busy year personally and professionally so it will be interesting to see where that leads me on this blog.</p>

<p>Thanks again for your continued interest and I hope you have a fruitful 2014.</p>
