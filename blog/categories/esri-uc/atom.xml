    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I have finalized my travel plans for San Diego to attend the ESRI User Conference this year. I will be spending most of my time on the exhibit floor working a booth. My company, <a href="http://www.zekiah.com">Zekiah Technologies</a>, became a <a href="http://www.zekiah.com/gsa">GSA reseller</a> for <a href="http://www.arc2earth.com">Arc2Earth</a> this year so Zekiah will have a joint booth with Arc2Earth.</p>

<p>I'll be there with Brian and Jack Flood and we'll have the newly-released Arc2Earth v3 on display. Come by booth 632 to see A2E Cloud Services (using Google's Cloud) in action as well as integration with <a href="http://www.arcgis.com/home/">ArcGIS.com</a> and a number of other features, including the new ability to export ArcGIS layer styles to <a href="http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/sld">SLD</a> (more on that in a future post). Don't forget the free A2E Community Edition. If you won't be at the UC, that's a great way to check out what it can do.</p>
