    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It's been a pretty good week for us at <a href="http://www.zekiah.com">Zekiah</a>. We announced two new <a href="http://www.zekiah.com/index.php?q=press/2013/09/16/zekiah-technologies-inc-wins-marine-corps-logistics-support-services-mclogss-contra">contract</a> <a href="http://www.zekiah.com/index.php?q=press/2013/09/16/zekiah-technologies-inc-awarded-contract-mission-assurance-division">wins</a> and I'm pleased to say that we're not done yet. After final paperwork is done, we should be able to announce a couple more. These are the things that make small-business ownership worthwhile: doing good work, building relationships with our customers and then leveraging our track record to be able to work with new customers. Project execution and business development help us build the foundation necessary to be a good place for our employees to work and we try hard every day to make sure that we are such a place.</p>

<p>The second contract win we announced this week, with the US Navy's Mission Assurance Division in Dahlgren, Virginia, is particularly fulfilling for us because we have worked side-by-side with that organization since the late 1990's, doing challenging work in the areas of infrastructure protection and situational awareness during that time. We have literally grown and evolved alongside them over that time.</p>

<p>I typically try not to mix my blog with the daily operational aspects of my work at Zekiah. Usually, my work comes through in abstracted form in various posts, although many posts actually reflect my own personal experimentation and side projects. I'm stepping outside of that practice today to say that our latest contract win has given us <a href="http://www.zekiah.com/index.php?q=careers/openings/gis-software-developer-ii">an opening for a software developer</a> to come work with us at the Mission Assurance Division.</p>

<p>This is an immediate opening and you would be performing .Net development with the full range of Microsoft and Esri technologies. The work has been challenging and is mission-essential for not only our customer but their sponsors as well. The work would require you to be on-site full time but you would be working with one of the most talented teams of developers, both government and contractor, with which I have ever been associated. This is a group from which I have learned a great deal and still do. This specific position is not for someone who is particularly senior but it is also not entry-level either. It's a great opportunity to grow a career that's underway and picking up steam.</p>

<p>You can get some details by checking out the <a href="http://www.zekiah.com/index.php?q=careers/openings/gis-software-developer-ii">offical job posting</a>, where you can also apply online. Most of that language is pulled directly from the description in the contract. If you want to get an idea of what the day-to-day work looks like, <a href="http://blog.geomusings.com/about/">you can always contact me directly</a>. I will draw your attention to one requirement, however: "Active security clearance or the ability to obtain a security clearance." What that means is that we can't entertain staffing via offshoring, nor can we consider applicants who do not hold US citizenship. I bring that up only because everyone's time is valuable and I'd hate for you to waste your time applying if we can't consider you.</p>

<p>So, if you're looking for the next challenge in your career and want to work with a great team, please send us your vitals. Some of the best and most meaningful work I've done in my career was done supporting this customer.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A friend who is in the midst of a career change and moving into the GIS world asked me for some pointers to resources for getting started with Python. I threw the question out to Twitter (with a similar variation also posted to Google+):</p>

<p><div class='embed tweet'><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>Can anyone recommend any good online Python training sources for beginners? Asking for a friend in the midst of a career change.</p>&mdash; Bill Dollins (@billdollins) <a href="https://twitter.com/billdollins/status/313263420923338753">March 17, 2013</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div></p>

<p>I got a couple of requests to summarize any information I received, which seemed reasonable. I got quite a few responses and here are some links:</p>

<p>I can't claim to have checked out all of them, but I consider the recommendations to have come from trusted sources. So, if you're <a href="http://blog.geomusings.com/2013/01/30/yes-you-need-to-code/">looking to expand your GIS expertise by adding some Python knowledge</a>, these may be a good place to start. Not all of them are free-of-charge since that wasn't one of my friend's requirements.</p>

<p>Additionally, Dan Dye informs me that the PyBulls Python interest group at the University of South Florida will take up this question and post a document with a list of resources on GitHub. Be sure to keep an eye on <a href="https://github.com/pybulls/">https://github.com/pybulls/</a> . Thank you!</p>
