    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When I was in college, I had a psychology professor who posited that you could train a cat (a dodgy proposition at best) to take circuitous route to its food bowl by only rewarding that behavior. He was clearly a behaviorist and was convinced that you could completely condition the instinct to go straight to the food bowl out of the cat. To my knowledge, this professor did not own a cat and never attempted to test his assertion.</p>

<p>I was reminded of this after reading my friend Atanas Entchev's <a href="http://blog.entchev.com/2013/11/22/some-post-postgis-day-thoughts.aspx">post in reaction</a> to the <a href="http://postgis.net">PostGIS</a> Day <a href="http://www.spatiallyadjusted.com/2013/11/21/todays-hangout-postgis-day-extravaganza-panel/">hangout panel discussion</a>. In his post, <a href="http://twiiter.com/atanas">Atanas</a> describes difficulty in convincing customers to consider open-source geospatial tools. These customers and prospects are comfortable with their proprietary tools and associated workflows and are reluctant to consider switching. I have encountered this attitude many times myself so I take no issue with the observation. Barriers to exit are real considerations, regardless of the new technology being considered. Organizations align themselves around their tools to achieve maximum efficiency with them. I discussed these issues at a talk I gave last year to the <a href="https://njgin.state.nj.us/OIT_NJGF/index.jsp">New Jersey Geospatial Forum</a> about how organizations can extend their existing geospatial technology investments with open-source technologies. These issues are very real for any organization with a mature, extended investment in a particular technology stack.</p>

<p>Atanas went on to liken the attitude to that with which some people view alternative medicine and I can see his point. Traditional GIS has set itself apart from the rest of the technology world for so long that users are generally conditioned to believe that GIS workflows should involve a series of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rube_Goldberg">Rube Goldberg</a> machinations involving file-based data sets, some proprietary scripting, and possibly some application-level business logic to relate and/or join data as necessary. This has taken various forms over the years but diagrams of those workflows tend to look the same.</p>

<p>Standing in contrast to such things, PostGIS looks alien, or "alternative." In truth, it is not "alternative" but rather "standard." As an example, here is <a href="http://blog.geomusings.com/assets/demos/nbi/">a map I produced a few weeks ago</a> showing the average ages of bridges by county. (I am not a cartographer.) It is a simple aggregation of the <a href="http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/bridge/nbi.cfm">National Bridge Inventory</a>, which consists of tens of thousands of records by county (3100-ish records). All of the data processing was done in PostgreSQL/PostGIS using nothing more exotic than SQL aggregate functions and some joins. None of the operations took longer than 6 seconds on my very pedestrian laptop. When I was done, I used QGIS to play with visualization and then dump out the static GeoJSON for use in Leaflet.</p>

<p>For my many friends who are regular users of PostGIS, this is nothing exotic. For some of my friends who regularly use commercial tools, this is interesting but not earth-shattering. But for a large portion of my friends who are comfortable with traditional tools and workflows, the time-to-market for this effort (35 minutes from the time I downloaded the NBI to the time I pushed the map to GitHub) has them taking notice. This entire workflow involved SQL extended with OGC-compliant spatial objects. (Side note: I have been hard on OGC's web efforts but the Simple Features Specification has been a quiet workhorse across the geospatial industry for over a decade. It's a good example of the benefit that well-designed standards can provide.) The map is being served from static content over simple HTTP with some client-side Javascript handling visualization. No heavy APIs or middleware involved or needed. The QGIS part was really necessitated by own cartographic limitations, but I could have fully generated the GeoJSON from SQL as well.</p>

<p>This example is fairly simplistic but I have good friends that are using PostGIS, and nothing more, to perform analyses and produce results for decision makers while sitting in meetings. This type of turnaround is standard in other market segments and the geospatial industry should expect nothing less. It requires nothing more than a strong foundation in SQL, mastery of spatial processes, and detailed understanding of your own data.</p>

<p>So I have come to realize that the mainstream GIS community has become very much like my professor's theoretical cat; conditioned to take the long way to the end result when more direct paths are clearly available. What's more, they have become conditioned to think of such approaches as normal. Geospatial analytical operations can be very complex and the approaches to performing them were, in the past, necessarily convoluted due to the lack of understanding of spatial data types and operations within mainstream platforms. Those barriers have been rapidly disappearing over the past decade or so, but the user community has been slow to let go of its comfort with familiar tools and convoluted approaches. As I stated above, organizational barriers to exit are real considerations, but the inherent efficiencies available in modern geospatial tools such as PostGIS make the transition worth the effort.</p>

    <id>http://blog.geomusings.com/2013/11/19/gis-day-after</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It's the morning of November 21st, but not for long. You open one eye. Just one; it's best not to rush such things. Apparently, you finally came to rest in the ball pit you all made using the squishy globes from myriad conferences past. A cursory scan tells you the GIS lab is trashed. It starts to come back to you: the rousing game of "Pin the Certificate on the Khakis." Yes, there are your pleated khakis on the wall with everyone's training and GISP certificates stuck on or around them with pushpins. Someone won in what would have been a most painful way if the khakis had been on your body. The loin cloth fashioned from the old hard-copy topos (which you are still wearing). The fact that you let the intern talk you into finally opening a Twitter account and your glee at discovering you could attach photos to geocoded tweets with your BlackBerry.</p>

<p>You look around the room at your coworkers strewn across the floor. There's the ArcObjects guy still sporting his "war paint" from the plotter toner. There's your lead analyst with a face tattoo of the town's land-use drawn in marker and, she proudly insisted, accurately projected in state plane. Slowly, you are able to account for everyone on your GIS staff. Good, no one has gone missing...except the intern.</p>

<p>The door opens and you turn to see the intern standing there in all of her college-kid resilience, letting in far too much sunlight for your comfort. You're not sure it's possible to hate anyone more in this moment.</p>

<p>"Oh, good," she says, "you're awake. Are you going to do the hangout?"</p>

<p>"Hangout?" you mumble.</p>

<p>"Yeah, <a href="http://www.spatiallyadjusted.com/2013/11/18/postgis-day-special-hangout-this-week/">James Fee is doing a PostGIS Day hangout with a panel of experts on PostGIS</a>. I told you about this. I told you about <a href="http://postgis.net">PostGIS</a>. Don't you remember? It starts in about an hour."</p>

<p>It does sound familiar. You give it some thought. What better way to shake off the cobwebs from the bacchanalia of the "BEST GIS DAY EVAR!!!" (so says the hand-lettered Sharpie on the lab's wall) than a little geo-hair-of-the-dog? Maybe it's time to finally pay attention to this open-source stuff. You look around to survey the damage one more time. Besides, ditching the Oracle license might just about pay for this.</p>

<p>"Yeah," you reply, "I'll be there in five minutes. Close the door, please."</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.linkedin.com/groupItem?view=&amp;srchtype=discussedNews&amp;gid=3300945&amp;item=242507385&amp;type=member&amp;trk=eml-anet_dig-b-pop_ttl-hdp&amp;ut=12tcrQvogVeRM1">Thanks to LinkedIn</a>, I saw that Dr. Art Lembo of Salisbury (Maryland) University is leading an "Open Source/Enterprise GIS Summer Bootcamp" at the university from June 3 - 7, 2013. All of the salient details, including contact information, <a href="http://www.esrgc.org/bootcamp/SUBootCamp.pdf">can be found here</a> (PDF).</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"> <img src="http://blog.geomusings.com/images/posts/river.jpg" /></p>

<p>Having seen Dr. Lembo and his team in action <a href="http://blog.geomusings.com/2013/03/20/the-best-thing-i-saw-at-tugis-2013/">for an afternoon at TUGIS</a>, I think this will be a good way for those who have been wanting to take the leap with open-source GIS tools to get some hands-on experience with core tools like <a href="http://qgis.org/">QGIS</a> and <a href="http://postgis.net/">PostGIS</a>. It's also a great time of year to be on Maryland's Eastern Shore. The LinkedIn discussion says there are still spaces available but the date is coming up soon so you'll want to move quickly if you're interested.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Just a quick note to tidy up some loose ends related to recent posts...</p>

<p>First, regarding the post "<a href="http://blog.geomusings.com/2013/03/17/a-lazyweb-compendium-of-python-resources-for-beginners/">A #LazyWeb Compendium of Python Resources for Beginners</a>," the University of South Florida PyBulls Python interest group, as promised, compiled a list of Python resources and posted it <a href="https://github.com/PyBulls/learning-resources">on their GitHub page</a>. Thanks to them for their quick response.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"> <img src="http://img.ehowcdn.com/article-new/ehow/images/a06/kv/li/proper-cutting-down-tree-chainsaw-800x800.jpg" /></p>

<p>Second, following up on the post "<a href="http://blog.geomusings.com/2013/03/20/the-best-thing-i-saw-at-tugis-2013/">The Best Thing I Saw at TUGIS 2013</a>," the data and workbooks for Dr. Arthur Lembo's introduction to open-source GIS have been made available. The data <a href="https://github.com/esrgc/qgistraining">can be found on GitHub</a> and the workbooks can be found on the <a href="http://www.esrgc.org/training/">Eastern Shore Regional GIS Cooperative web site</a>. Many thanks for contributing these resources.</p>

<p>These items are embedded in the comments for their respective posts but I thought it would be useful to call them out more prominently.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I spent the day yesterday at <a href="http://www.towson.edu/">Towson University</a> attending the <a href="http://www.towson.edu/tugis/">TUGIS 2013</a> conference. The new one-day format was a firehose that showcased the diversity of geospatial work occurring across the State of Maryland. The keynote by <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=44978536">Learon Dalby</a> was well-received and the content of the conference was generally substantive. While the day was a sprint, there was one workshop that really caught my attention more so than I would have thought from its title.</p>

<p>The photo below shows 40 participants of an "Introduction to Free and Open Source GIS Software" workshop getting hands-on experience with <a href="http://www.qgis.org">QGIS</a> and <a href="http://www.postgis.org">PostGIS</a> by working through prepared but realistic scenarios. These scenarios included doing multi-user editing and performing spatial analysis to assess the effects of a potential toxic release over a small town.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"> <img src="http://blog.geomusings.com/images/posts/tugis2013_workshop.jpg" /></p>

<p>The workshop was put together by <a href="http://faculty.salisbury.edu/~ajlembo/">Dr. Arthur Lembo</a> of <a href="http://www.salisbury.edu/">Salisbury University</a> and conducted by him and a team of his students, who not only led portions of the workshop but were also stationed around the room to provide guidance to participants. The scenarios were prepared in printed workbooks that the participants were free to take with them, along with information about how to download the tools. All-in-all, I thought the workshop was very well-designed and presented a thorough overview of the capabilities of these two tools.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>To be sure, the workshop was not all unicorns and rainbows. There were typical glitches such as file system and database permission issues that required on-the-fly adjustments, which Dr. Lembo and his students handled well. Some participants were clearly stumped at points while others were making good headway with the examples.</p>

<p>Many of the participants probably remain committed <a href="http://www.esri.com">ArcGIS</a> users after the workshop while others may very well dig in and more thoroughly explore QGIS and PostGIS, but that's really beside the point. Regardless of what the individual participants decide to do with the information from the workshop, all left with hands-on exposure to the tools that was presented in a manner that was free of hyperbole, FUD, or market-speak. They now have more first-hand information with which to make their own educated decisions as to how they want to proceed with their geospatial technology choices; and that, in my opinion, may have been the most valuable outcome of the workshop.</p>
