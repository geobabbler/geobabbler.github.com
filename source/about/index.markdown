My name is Bill Dollins and I am a consultant specializing in the integration of geospatial technologies into mainstream IT environments. I have been working primarily for US Federal and DoD organizations since the early 1990s. During that time, I have worked with most major commercial and open-source geospatial technologies, as well as most major programming languages and database platforms. I am equally comfortable with web, desktop and mobile development.

I am a Senior Vice President at <a href="http://www.zekiah.com">Zekiah Technologies</a> where I lead many geospatial efforts in support of our customers. This is my personal blog on matters related to programming, geospatial technologies, consulting and any other issues that may cross my mind.

I am available for consulting for projects related to geospatial technologies, software development, system design or implementation. I can be reached by e-mail at <a href="mailto:bill@geomusings.com?subject=Blog Visit">bill@geomusings.com</a> .
