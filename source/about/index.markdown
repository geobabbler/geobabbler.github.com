My name is Bill Dollins and I am a consultant specializing in the integration of geospatial technologies. I have supported US Federal, state, local, commercial, and non-profit organizations with geospatial system design, development, and deployment services since the early 1990s. During that time, I have worked with most major commercial and open-source geospatial technologies, as well as many major programming languages and database platforms. I am equally comfortable with web, desktop and mobile development.
