<a href="http://abegillespie.blogspot.com/2009/01/ziggis-candy.html">Abe posted</a> today about upcoming enhancements in <a href="http://pub.obtusesoft.com">zigGIS</a> 2.0.2. These changes address some of the most common feedback that we've heard from users. Abe has been working hard to get these changes implemented and released in a timely fashion. Testing will begin shortly.

In addition to the flexibility that Abe describes, these changes also begin to position zigGIS to support other data sources beyond PostGIS.
