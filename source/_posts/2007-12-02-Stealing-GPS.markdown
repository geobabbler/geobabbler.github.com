BETHESDA, Md. - On two nights earlier this month, several cars were broken into in Bethesda, police said. The break-ins occurred overnight Nov. 7 to Nov. 8 and overnight Nov. 11 to Nov. 12, police said. Between the two nights, a total of 49 cars were broken into. 

The culprits stole global positioning systems.</em>
