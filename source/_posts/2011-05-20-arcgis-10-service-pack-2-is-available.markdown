Esri announced late today that Service Pack 2 for ArcGIS 10 is available. It looks like <a href="http://downloads2.esri.com/support/downloads/other_/ArcGIS-10sp2-issues.htm">a fairly sizable list of issues</a> was addressed with this service pack.

Who knows, we could be witnessing history as this could potentially be the last service pack to address ArcIMS. (Well, I can dream, can't I?)

Anyway, if you're among those who like to wait until the second service pack before doing an Esri upgrade, you can now start putting 9.3 out to pasture. Live it up!
