Paolo has created an <a href="http://ziggis.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/download/ZigGis11.zip">installer</a>?for zigGIS and has also posted an <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/ziggis/browse_frm/thread/8e6ffb8c38db1713">installation guide</a>. He has packaged together all of the correct versions of the supporting components so it solves the problems I described in an <a href="http://geobabble.wordpress.com/2006/12/17/postgis-and-arcgis-91/">earlier post</a>. I would highly recommend using the installer to get started.
