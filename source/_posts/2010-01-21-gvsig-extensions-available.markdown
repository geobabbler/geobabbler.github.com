My inbox has been busy this week with announcements from <a href="http://www.gvsig.gva.es/inicio-gvsig/">gvSIG</a>. New builds of the network extension and the 3D extension have been released.

New features of the network extension are described as:

<blockquote>
"- Create and define network topology (using velocities, or sense of direction, modified costs, barriers, turn costs ...)
- Calculate shortest path
- Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP)
- Origin - Destination matrices
- Service Areas
- Emergency / Nearest facilities provider
- Minimum Spanning Tree (MSP)
- Trace (back and forward) the network and find events on the network."
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
"- New kernel version integrated (osgVP-2.2.0).
- Improved memory management .
- Added new symbology system.
- Various display modes, including stereo and fullscreen."
</blockquote>
