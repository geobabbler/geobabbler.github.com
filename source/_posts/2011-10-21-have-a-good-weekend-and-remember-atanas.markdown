I'm about to head out for the weekend. As we get ready to go about our weekend activities, let's not forget that Atanas Entchev and his family are <a href="http://njgeo.org/2011/10/17/colleague-in-need-atanas-entchev/">still</a> being <a href="http://www.cecintl.com/facilities_rr_nj_006.html">detained</a>. If you have not yet donated to the <a href="http://www.tenthcave.com/2011/10/plea-for-help.html">Entchev legal fund</a>, please take time to do so before you head out. Please keep them in your thoughts and <a href="https://writerep.house.gov/writerep/welcome.shtml">take action</a> on their behalf.
