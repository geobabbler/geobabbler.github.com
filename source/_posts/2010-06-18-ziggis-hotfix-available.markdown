Abe announced the availability of hotfix 3 for <a href="http://pub.obtusesoft.com">zigGIS</a> 2.0.5. From the announcement:

<blockquote>Hotfix 3 fixes an issue that prevented point layers from being
editable; it also includes all prior hotfixes.  The hotfix is a free
upgrade and is highly recommended for all users.  Please go to
<a href="http://pub.obtusesoft.com">http://pub.obtusesoft.com</a> &gt; My Order.  After logging in you'll see a
link to the patch.</blockquote>

<a href="http://abegillespie.blogspot.com">Abe</a> is working hard on <a href="http://geobabble.wordpress.com/2010/04/23/ziggis-3-0-to-be-open-source/">version 3.0</a> but obviously is continuing to support 2.x as well. Improvements include a new provider model which will better enable support for other data sources. A roadmap should be available soon.
