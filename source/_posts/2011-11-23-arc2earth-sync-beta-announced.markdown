Over on <a href="https://plus.google.com/112324940962843535547/posts/B9T9M1vPLCz">Google+</a> (and also on Twitter), <a href="http://twitter.com/bflood">Brian Flood</a> announced the impending availability of Arc2Earth Sync Beta to existing <a href="http://www.arc2earth.com">Arc2Earth</a> users. This has been brewing for for a while and Brian says it best:

<blockquote>
"What makes Sync really cool is the live edit synchronization and the ability to publish online to different formats. It's a great way to provide integration between ArcGIS desktops/online and the other Cloud database providers like Google."
</blockquote>

So it gives users the ability to publish, edit and synchronize data they are storing in on-line, hosted environments using the editing tools of ArcMap. The initial beta will only support Google Fusion Tables but support for Google Earth Builder and - this caught my eye right away - <a href="http://cartodb.com">CartoDB</a> are scheduled for after the first of the year.

There are a lot of ArcGIS for Desktop users out there and exposing different hosted solutions using workflows and tools with which they are comfortable has the potential to do a lot for user choice and the ability to control one's own data.
