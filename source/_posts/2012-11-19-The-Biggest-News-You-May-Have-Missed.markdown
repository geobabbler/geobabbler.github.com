In case you missed it, this tweet floated across the Twitters last week:

Yes, the team at <a href="http://www.arc2earth.com">Arc2Earth</a> is apparently working on a new feature in <a href="http://www.arc2earth.com/services/sync/">Arc2Earth Sync,</a> called TileMill Connect, that will link <a href="http://www.esri.com">ArcMap</a> MXDs with <a href="http://mapbox.com/tilemill/">TileMill</a>. This will allow users to migrate their ArcMap cartography into TileMill to take advantage of the rich tools there as well as the potential for version control and cut/paste sharing of techniques and best practices enabled by <a href="http://mapbox.com/tilemill/docs/manual/carto/">CartoCSS</a>.

<a href="http://twitter.com/bFlood">Brian Flood</a> followed that up today with a short video showing it in action.

No word on a timetable for this feature, but I can't wait to kick the tires. I am especially intrigued by the pseudo <a href="http://www.postgis.org">PostGIS</a> proxy service that enables connections to ArcGIS data sources.
