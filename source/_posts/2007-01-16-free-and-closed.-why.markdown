I was IMing with <a href="http://www.paolocorti.net">Paolo</a>?today and we were discussing his employer's decision to migrate to open-source. The conversation took a few turns and we touched upon the concept of free closed-source software vice free open-source software. His employer had rejected a free CMS that was not open-source.

This got me into a philosophical frame of mind. I began wondering if, in this day and age, there is any reason to consciously choose to release a software product as a free, but closed-source product? I raised this question a while back with regard to <a href="http://geobabble.wordpress.com/2006/12/28/why-isnt-arcgis-explorer-open-source/">ArcGIS Explorer</a>?but now I'm expanding the question. I would love to hear comments on this but I'd like to establish a few parameters:
<ol>
	<li>I'm not interested in delving into the open-source vs. commercial software debate.</li>
	<li>I'm not trying to criticize anyone who chooses to keep their source code closed. I'm genuinely curious about the decision process.</li>
	<li>I'm not referring to things like "nagware", demo software with restricted functionality or free products that are really teasers for commercial products (which is what?I consider <a href="http://www.ogleearth.com/2006/06/google_earth_at.html">Google Earth</a> to be).</li>
	<li>Please keep it civil. We're all grown-ups and/or professionals.</li>
</ol>
I look forward to hearing your thoughts.
