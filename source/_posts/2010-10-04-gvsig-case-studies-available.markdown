The <a href="http://www.osgeo.org/gvsig">gvSIG (open-source desktop GIS)</a> project now has a site listing gvSIG implementation case studies. It is available at:

<a href="http://casestudies.gvsig.org/">http://casestudies.gvsig.org/</a>

A quick perusal of the site shows a few case studies covering a variety of application areas. This type of thing could be a good way to showcase (and market) the power of gvSIG to a wider audience. It looks like you have to fill out a standardized form in order to submit a project, which gives the resulting case studies consistent and fairly clean structure.

There's no indication of the acceptance criteria for a case study but it looks like something to keep an eye on for a while. 

So, if you're a gvSIG user or consultant, then here's a place to toot your horn.
