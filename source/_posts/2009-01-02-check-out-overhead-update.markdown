Matt Faulkner has done a nice job of creating what amounts to be a geospatial feed dashboard with <a href="http://www.overheadupdate.com">Overhead Update</a>. It has quickly become one of the first places I visit each day. <a href="http://blog.davebouwman.net/2008/12/20/OverheadUpdatecomAllTopForGeospatial.aspx">Dave</a> and <a href="http://blog.gisuser.com/?p=3322">Glenn</a> have already blogged about it but I figure spreading the word a little more can't hurt. Also, Matt was kind enough to include me.

I also suggest checking out Matt's other site: <a href="http://www.virtualbirdseye.com/">Virtual Bird's Eye</a>.
