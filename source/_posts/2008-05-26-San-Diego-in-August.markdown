Beats the heck out of Washington in August.

I'll be doing booth duty most of the week at the <a href="http://esri.com/events/uc/">ESRI UC</a> this year. I'll be in booth 612 doing the old soft-shoe for <a href="http://www.zekiah.com">Zekiah</a>. Feel free to stop by and say hello. I'm hoping there will be some good off-site meetups.

This trip will complete my 2008 ESRI conference trifecta (quad-fecta if you count the BP Conference/Dev Summit as two distinct events). I wear a lot of hats in my business and this conference is good for the business side. It'll be <em>really</em> hard to top the technical content of the Dev Summit (and I'm not expecting it) but, based on the Where 2.0 <a href="http://twitter.com">Twitter</a> buzz (and, yes, there was Where 2.0 Twitter buzz), I think there'll even more good stuff about 9.3. I'll probably blog in more detail in the near future but I think 9.3 may be the most significant ArcGIS release since 8.0.
