So the <a href="http://support.esri.com/index.cfm?fa=knowledgebase.documentation.viewDoc&amp;PID=17&amp;MetaID=1555">upcoming release</a> of ArcGIS 9.3.1 SP1 <a href="http://downloads2.esri.com/support/documentation/ao_/9.3.1_SP1_Announcement9_1.pdf">addresses a lot of issues</a>. I am somewhat curious why it's not being called 9.3.2. Calling it a service pack seems to be mixing metaphors. Hopefully, ESRI will reconsider before it hits the street.
