According to Manning Publications, the print version of "PostGIS In Action" , by Regina Obe and Leo Hsu, <a href="http://www.manning.com/obe/">will be available starting today</a>. I <a href="http://geobabble.wordpress.com/2010/04/21/a-look-at-postgis-in-action/">reviewed it</a> a while back and <a href="http://www.spatiallyadjusted.com/2011/04/07/psa-postgis-in-action-to-arrive-april-13th/">James tipped us</a> to its impending availability last week.

If you are working with <a href="http://postgis.refractions.net/">PostGIS</a>, whether on its own or through the use of PostGIS geometries in the ArcGIS stack, this is a book you want to have. Quite frankly, it's the kind of book I wish existed for a few other spatial database platforms, also.

"PostGIS In Action" is the best one-stop resource to help you get the most out of PostGIS. I can't put it any more plainly than that. Check it out and enjoy.
