This is WAY off-topic, for those of hitting this from Planet GS or an aggregator.

My deified status as been confirmed!

I was doing my weekly perusal of my spam folder to make sure SpamBayes didn't actually filter something valid. I'm sure everyone has been getting the bogus "you've received a greeting card from a friend/family member/classmate/colleague/etc." messages.

This one made me laugh...

I've always had a pretty high opinion of myself but I have apparently not been aiming high enough!

We now return to regularly scheduled programming.
