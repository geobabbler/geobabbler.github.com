I was researching the Google Earth COM API and came upon this little gem in its documentation regarding backward compatibility:

<blockquote>Note About Backwards Compatibility

In all likelihood, future versions of the Google Earth COM API will be fully backwards compatible with the current version.</blockquote>

I am now sufficiently inspired to continue. :)
