Data licensing has always been an important issue but seems to be [moving to the forefront](http://www.spatiallyadjusted.com/2012/12/26/this-isnt-the-road-network-you-are-looking-for/) as demand for quality spatial data grows. This workshop could prove to be timely. It is being held on 24 January 2013 in Tysons Corner, VA. Details can be found on the [Spatial Law and Policy blog](http://spatiallaw.blogspot.com/2012/12/geospatial-data-licensing-workshop.html).
