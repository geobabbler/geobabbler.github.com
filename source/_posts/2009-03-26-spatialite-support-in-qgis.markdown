Alessandro announced on <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/spatialite-users">SpatiaLite group</a> today that <a href="http://www.qgis.org/">QGIS</a> 1.1 will include a data provider for <a href="http://www.gaia-gis.it/spatialite/">SpatiaLite</a>, the spatial extender for SQLite.

It's out there now in the SVN trunk if you're so inclined. I am curious how long it will take to cascade through to the <a href="http://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/OSGeo_Win32_Installer">OSGEO4W</a> build.

If you haven't check out SpatiaLite, I highly encourage you to do so. It is powerful and <em>very</em> lightweight.
