Over on the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/spatialite-users">SpatiaLite Google Group</a>, <a href="http://www.stineconsulting.com/">Stine Consulting</a> announced the availability of <a href="http://www.stineconsulting.com/GIS%20Resources.php">2011 TIGER Boundary files</a> in <a href="http://www.gaia-gis.it/gaia-sins/">SpatiaLite</a> format.

Despite initial enthusiasm, mainstream uptake of SpatiaLite has been slow but I think that's about to change. Large organizations, such as the US Army, are showing a much more serious interest in SpatiaLite as they expand their use of mobile and hand-held platforms.

I expect that increased availability of data in native SpatiaLite databases will also help adoption. So if you need US boundaries data, check out this offering from Stine Consulting. And, if you're looking for more data for use in SpatiaLite, don't forget that you can download any dataset available on <a href="http://www.geocommons.com">GeoCommons</a> as a SpatiaLite database.
