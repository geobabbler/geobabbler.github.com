The <a href="http://www.esri.com/events/feduc/index.html">ESRI Federal User Conference</a> is almost here. I'll be going this year because my <a href="http://www.zekiah.com">company</a> is doing a booth. I like to refer to this event as the "UC-Lite" in that it's smaller and more focused.

I highly encourage anyone in the DC/MD/VA region to go. First of all, admission is free to all federal employees and it's only $100 for state and local employees. If you can take the time and have the travel budget, I'd say go. Although, it's the "Federal" UC, there's enough general exposure to ESRI technology that this event is a nice alternative for those who can't make San Diego. Basically, you see a lot of government applications of the technology but the concepts will cross over well to other markets and applications.

Of course, this event occurs in my back yard so I'd like to see it thrive. See ya in DC...
