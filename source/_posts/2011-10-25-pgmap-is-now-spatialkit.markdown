<a href="http://blog.geomusings.com/2011/08/09/taking-a-look-at-pgmap/">I blogged a while back on PgMap</a>, a freeware ArcGIS extension for directly connecting to PostGIS. <a href="http://st-links.com/default.aspx">ST-Links</a>, the makers of PgMap, sent out an e-mail this morning announcing that PgMap and QMap (the equivalent technology for interacting with SQL Server 2008 spatial data) have been combined into a single tool called SpatialKit. This move comes as part of the 3.0 release of the tool.

The same announcement also mentioned a <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/spatialkit?hl=en">Google Group dedicated to SpatialKit</a>. When I took a look at PgMap before, it seemed to be a pretty nice tool so I'm looking forward to digging into this. If you were a previous user of zigGIS, or if you have experimented with ArcSquirrel for SQL Server 2008 access, you may want to check out SpatialKit.
