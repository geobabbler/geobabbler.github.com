It's been four years to the day since I started this blog. This was not my first attempt at blogging but I wasn't happy with my first one so it's been lost to the recycle bin of history. It was (and still is) intended to be an outlet for my observations and experiences arising from my work. Sometimes, that means I post code and other times it means I post rants.

My <a href="http://geobabble.wordpress.com/2006/12/01/irasterlayer-export-gotcha-in-92/">first post</a> was regarding a bug with raster layers in ArcGIS 9.2. That project evolved to include the use of <a href="http://sharpmap.codeplex.com/">SharpMap</a> and <a href="http://postgis.refractions.net/">PostGIS</a>, which led me to get involved with <a href="http://www.obtusesoft.com">zigGIS</a>. From there, I got more involved with open-source GIS while also staying current with the various permutations of <a href="http://www.esri.com">Esri</a> technology (I can now say I was working with it when it was "EE ESS ARE EYE").

Today, I'm still working with a lot of Esri tools (especially since I still do a lot of work for the government) but I still maintain a mix of open-source tools and, more recently, have begun working with various cloud platforms (see recent posts on <a href="http://www.weogeo.com">WeoGeo</a>, <a href="http://www.geocommons.com">GeoCommons </a>and <a href="http://www.arc2earth.com">Arc2Earth</a>). 

So, whereas I was probably spending over 80% of my time working with ESRI tools when I started, I'd say that number is closer to 50% now. I would not, however, read much into that other than my own personal decisions. I feel the broader perspective of working with a variety of tools makes me a better <a href="http://www.zekiah.com">consultant</a>, regardless of which platform my customer has chosen.

Over the past four years, I have gotten to know a lot of very smart people as a direct result of this blog so it's definitely been a positive experience for me. 

To all who have stopped by over that time, please accept my sincerest thanks.
