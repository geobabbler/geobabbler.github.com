I'm off with the family for a week of sun, sand and frothy umbrella drinks. 

I've spent the last couple of days working on a <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/netframework/aa663324.aspx">WCF</a> web service wrapping some <a href="http://postgis.refractions.net/">PostGIS</a> calls. I hope to be able to write about it not long after I get back. I'm also continuing with the ArcCatalog objects for <a href="http://code.google.com/p/ziggis">zigGIS</a> but work has had this funny way of intruding lately.

See you later...
