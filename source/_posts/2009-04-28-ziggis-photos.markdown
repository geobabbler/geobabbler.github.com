Paolo was kind enough to post photos of the <a href="http://pub.obtusesoft.com">zigGIS</a> team from our time in New York. You can find them <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/paoloandrenata/tags/ziggis/">here</a>. This was the first time the three of us had met up and we had a great time.

We had some discussions about the way ahead for zigGIS and there are some big things in store that we'll announce as we firm them up.

It was also great of Brian Flood to come out and hang for a bit.
