It's been an especially cold and dreary winter in Maryland so far but respite for the winter-weary Mid-Atlantic geo-geek comes in the form of the North Carolina GIS Conference (<a href="http://www.cgia.state.nc.us/Default.aspx?alias=www.cgia.state.nc.us/ncgis2011">NCGIS</a>), being held in Raleigh, NC this year.

I've always heard good things about NCGIS and am happy to have the chance to go this year. Even better, it's within driving distance so I can get out on the open road for a bit. I'm giving a talk in the session titles "The Desktop App: News of My Death is Premature." I've been told to expect some #geoglobaldomination Thursday night as well. It should be a good time.
