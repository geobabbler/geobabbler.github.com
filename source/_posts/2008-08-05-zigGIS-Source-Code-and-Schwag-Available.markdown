<a href="http://abegillespie.blogspot.com">Abe</a> has announced that the source code for zigGIS is now available (governed by the zigGIS EULA). It can be found at <a href="http://www.obtusesoft.com/source.aspx">http://www.obtusesoft.com/source.aspx</a>.

Additionally, there is now zigGIS apparel available at <a href="http://www.cafepress.com/obtusesoft">http://www.cafepress.com/obtusesoft</a> (just because it's fun...and a little geeky).

No, there is not an option to have the source code printed on a shirt.

Enjoy both....
