According to this <a href="http://www.gisuser.com/content/view/14986/">press release</a>, ArcGIS 9.3 started shipping today. ESRI has pretty much stuck to the aggressive schedule that they announced at the Dev Summit.

My experiences thus far with the beta and the release candidate have been pretty positive so it'll be good to get the final product.

Who's starting the pool on the when the first service pack will be out?  ;)
