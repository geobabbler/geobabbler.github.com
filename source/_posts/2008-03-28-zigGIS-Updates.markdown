For those that are interested, Abe has been posting screencasts of the the improvements to zigGIS at the <a href="http://www.obtusesoft.com">Obtuse</a> site. The zigGIS 2.0 beta will be out soon. The performance of the direct connect to PostGIS has been greatly improved and full editing has been implemented using native ArcGIS tools.

There is also a <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/ziggis?lnk=srg">Google group</a> you can join if you want to stay imformed.
