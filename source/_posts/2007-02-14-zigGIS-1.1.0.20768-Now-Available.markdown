<a href="http://www.paolocorti.net">Paolo</a> moves fast! The new installer is available for download at the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/ziggis">zigGIS project home</a>. Bear in mind that zigGIS depends on the ArcObjects .NET libraries. A good post on making sure you've got them is available <a href="http://mrrichie.spaces.live.com/blog/cns!DD16C3F34F4D913E!582.entry">here</a>.

The last version had over 200 downloads. Please feel free to post feedback at the project site. All feedback helps us make it better.
