Another <a href="http://www.meetup.com/DevMeetUpNortheast/events/37184672/">ESRI Dev Meetup is happening in the DC</a> area on November 10th. This time, it's at Fire Station One in Silver Spring, MD (kudos to <a href="http://twitter.com/geeknixta">Nick Furness</a> for doing a good job of moving them around the DMV). These are generally a good time and ESRI doesn't actually try to drive the content train too much. As a result, you can hear about the some interesting integration use cases. I can even attest that ESRI doesn't check your current maintenance status at the door!

I *think* they are still looking for lightning talks. Please sign up to do one or they'll have to fill in the open slots with technical marketing speak! Mine has been tentatively approved by Nick under the guidance "Don't say anything that'll get me fired."

I hope to see you there.
