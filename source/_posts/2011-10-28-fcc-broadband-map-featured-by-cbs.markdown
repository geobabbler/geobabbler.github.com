<a href="http://twitter.com/Byrne_Tweets">Michael Byrne</a> of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) gave a really good talk at FOSS4G, telling the story of the FCC <a href="http://www.broadbandmap.gov">National Broadband Map</a> application, which is built on open-source geospatial tools. In addition to being open-source, it's a modern web system that makes diligent use of caching and other techniques to achieve great performance. I do a lot of work in the Federal space and, in my opinion, it's one of best public-facing Federal web tools deployed in recent memory.

CBS News, <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-501465_162-20127020-501465/fcc-approves-$4.5-billion-for-broadband-in-era-of-steve-jobs/">in discussing a new $4.5 billion broadband fund by the FCC</a>, features a nice screenshot of the system. It's nice to see good work and innovation get recognized. Michael and his team should be proud.
