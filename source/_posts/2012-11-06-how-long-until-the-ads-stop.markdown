In celebration of this day when the non-stop political ads, robo-calls, junk mail, and social media posts *should* finally come to an end. I threw together a little map to show the latest time at which polls close in each state. This should represent, state-by-state, the time (EST) at which you can safely go back to answering your phones. Click the image below to go there (the data takes a couple of seconds to load).

Democracy is a wonderful thing, but it will be nice to have this campaign season behind us.
