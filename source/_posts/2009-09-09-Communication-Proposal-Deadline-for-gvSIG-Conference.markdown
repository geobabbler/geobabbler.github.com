As I <a href="http://geobabble.wordpress.com/2009/06/30/5th-gvsig-conference-announced/">posted before</a>, the 5th <a href="http://www.gvsig.gva.es/index.php?id=gvsig&amp;L=2">gvSIG</a> conference is scheduled for December 2-4, 2009 in Valencia. I got an e-mail reminder that communication proposals (presentations, posters, etc.) are due by September 21st. From the e-mail:

<blockquote>
We remind you that we are now expecting communication proposals for the 5th gvSIG Conference (Valencia, 2nd-4th December 2009) [1]. The deadline is September 21st.

You just have to send an abstract, following the template provided on the Reports section of the Conference web page [2] to contacto-jornadas-gvsig@gva.es and the scientific committee will evaluate it to be in the conference programme.

There are two types of communications: presentation and poster. The communications have to be preferably related to the gvSIG project and the following issues will be also be considered in the evaluation:

  * Innovation.
  * Usefulness for the GIS community.
  * Usefulness for the free open source community.
