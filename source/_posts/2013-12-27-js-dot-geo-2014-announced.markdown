Information about the follow-up to last year's [JS.Geo](http://www.jsgeo.org/) event has been percolating back-channel for a few weeks now. Now some [official details have been posted](http://lanyrd.com/2014/jsgeo14/). This year's event will be held in April in San Francisco. I attended last year's session, really liked the focused format, and got a lot of good information out of it. One thing that was nice was that, regardless of whether you are of an Esri or open-source persuasion in your development preferences, there was a lot of good information presented with a relative lack of hyperbole, which made it easy to focus on the content.

As [Todd Barr](http://twitter.com/geo_rube) [eloquently points out](http://drunkengeographer.tumblr.com/post/69908102132/when-i-realize-that-no-one-who-plans-gis-spatial), the April 2014 calender is somewhat crowded with geo-events but, based on last year's event, I'd recommend putting JS.Geo at the top of the list.
