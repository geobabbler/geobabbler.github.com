It seems this is quickly turning into the zigGIS blog. Anyway, it appears that <a href="http://www.paolocorti.net">Paolo Corti</a> has assumed the role of project lead on zigGIS and has moved it to <a href="http://code.google.com/p/ziggis/">Google Code</a>. I'm excited because I think this is a great project and this should keep it moving forward. There's also a group for discussing the project.

Thanks to Abe Gillespie and Paolo for collaborating to keep zigGIS going.
