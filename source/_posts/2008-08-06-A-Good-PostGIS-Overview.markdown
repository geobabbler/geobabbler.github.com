Steven Citron-Pousty gave a talk on PostGIS and has helpfully posted his slides <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/scitronpousty/using-post-gis-to-add-some-spatial-flavor-to-your-application">here</a>. It's a good introductory overview and provides some good examples of basic spatial SQL in PostGIS.

With ArcGIS Server now supporting PostgreSQL as a back end RDBMS and also supporting the use of PostGIS geometries, a lot of new users may be migrating to the PostgreSQL platform. This presentation is a good overview for anyone picking it up for the first time. Thanks, @TheSteve0!
