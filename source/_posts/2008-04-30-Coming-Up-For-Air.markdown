Work has a funny way of intruding on blogging. I've been writing a LOT of proposals lately. The funny part is that so have a lot of others that I know. Federal, state, local...they seem to have gotten their budgets all at the same time. There are worse problems to have.

During this period (which I am calling my "Word Period") I have been watching as <a href="http://abegillespie.blogspot.com">Abe</a> and <a href="http://www.paolocorti.net">Paolo</a> get <a href="http://obtusesoft.com">zigGIS</a> out the door. I was able to confirm that I indeed introduced a bug a couple of versions back. I guess you can't win 'em all.

I have been keeping my sanity by slinging a little code here and there. I am hoping to finish up an experimental <a href="http://twitter.com">Twitter</a> client for <a href="http://www.esri.com/software/arcgis/explorer/index.html">ArcGIS Explorer</a>. Mainly, it's an exercise to get me familiar with the Twitter and <a href="http://twittervision.com/">Twittervision</a> APIs. Plus, it's been a while since I've done anything with AGX. The upcoming builds look exciting so I want to get comfortable with it again.

There's light at the end of tunnel on the proposal stuff so I'm hoping to get a little more technical again here in the next couple of weeks. Until then, I'll have to accept the fact that Word, Paint.Net, Acrobat and Twhirl (all work and no play) have pushed Visual Studio and anything GIS related off my recently used list.
