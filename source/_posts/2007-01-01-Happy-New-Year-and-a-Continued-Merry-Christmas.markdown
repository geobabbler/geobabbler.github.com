Greetings to all and wishes for a peaceful and prosperous 2007. And, for those of you keeping track at home, today would be "seven swans a-swimming".

I'm heading out for a business trip tomorrow that keeps me gone for the rest of the week so it's time to pack away the decorations. Typically, we wait until after <a href="http://www.calendar-updates.com/info/holidays/us/threekings.aspx">Three King's Day</a> but my travel schedule won't allow for that this year.
