[David Bitner](https://twitter.com/bitnerd) sent out a reminder that Early Bird reagistration for the [FOSS4G North America](http://foss4g-na.org/) conference closes on 1 April 2013. After that, the price goes up by $50 US. You can register [online at EventBrite](http://foss4gna.eventbrite.com/).

The [preliminary program](http://foss4g-na.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/PreliminaryProgram.pdf) (PDF) for this year's event looks exceptional, building upon and potentially exceeding the outstanding quality of FOSS4G-NA 2012. I'll be sorry to miss the conference this year but will be looking forward to its social media exhaust.
