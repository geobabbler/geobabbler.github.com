<a href="http://obtusesoft.com">Obtuse Software</a> has established a Twitter account for zigGIS with the intent of using Twitter to broadcast status updates on zigGIS. The link to the zigGIS home on Twitter is: 

<a href="http://twitter.com/zigGIS">twitter.com/zigGIS</a>

Twitter users who are interested in keeping up to date as zigGIS 2.0 moves through beta into its release and beyond can simply follow zigGIS on Twitter. I highly encourage those that are interested to follow. Initially, this will be an outbound form of communication. We will tweet to anyone who follows but we will not be immediately following anyone.

It is a future goal of ours to evaluate the effectiveness of Twitter as a means of gathering feedback on zigGIS and integrating that feedback into the development process.
