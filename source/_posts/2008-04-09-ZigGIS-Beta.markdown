As zigGIS 2.0 enters its beta stage, I am (somewhat strangely) reminded of the famous line from Yeats:

"what rough beast, its hour come round at last,
Slouches towards Bethlehem to be born?"

Kind of a weird thing to have pop into your head in relation to something as positive as zigGIS, but sleep deprivation can do that.

Anyway, this is more of a status update than an invite. ZigGIS 2.0 is getting ready to enter its beta stage. The beta will be a closed beta amongst a subset of existing users. <a href="http://abegillespie.blogspot.com/2008/04/teb-beta.html">Abe has blogged about it.</a> It'll help us get it tested while also keeping the beta program manageable (for us).

So, for those who will be beta testing, now is the time. For the rest who are interested, zigGIS 2.0 is moving forward. More info can be found on Abe's blog and screencasts are available at the <a href="http://www.obtusesoft.com/">Obtuse</a> site.
