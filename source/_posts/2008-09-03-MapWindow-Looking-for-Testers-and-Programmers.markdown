<a href="http://www.mapwindow.org/">MapWindow</a> is has posted a message over on <a href="http://www.linkedin.com">LinkedIn</a> looking for testers and programmers. The text of the message, posted by Paul Meems, is:

<blockquote>Any GIS experts available with some free time?
Here at MapWindow GIS (<a href="http://www.mapwindow.org">www.mapwindow.org</a>) we're looking for people who are willing the use MapWindow (it's Open Source, so it's free to use) and share their experiences. We also have our own LinkedIn group: <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/e/gis/122945/37A6504A848A">http://www.linkedin.com/e/gis/122945/37A6504A848A</a></blockquote>

A follow-up answer to one of my LinkedIn contacts clarified that they are looking for testers and programmers. So, if you're interested in helping out an open-source project, here's your chance. Also, you may want to give LinkedIn a spin.
