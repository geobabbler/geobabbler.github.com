With 2011 upon us, here are a few things I hope to achieve this year (in no particular order):

<ul>
    <li>Enjoy life with my family</li>
	<li>Sharpen my Python skills</li>
	<li>Get better with Javascript</li>
	<li>Build at least one useful application with a NoSQL back-end</li>
	<li>Build at least one application that runs on a cloud infrastructure (maybe in conjunction with the previous three items)</li>
	<li>Get better with many of the cloud-based geospatial tools and deepen my proficiency with <a href="http://www.arc2earth.com">Arc2Earth</a>, <a href="http://www.weogeo.com">WeoGeo</a> and <a href="http://www.fortiusone.com">GeoIQ</a> offerings in this area</li>
	<li>Educate my customers (especially the Federal ones) and colleagues on all of these</li>
	<li>Grow <a href="http://www.zekiah.com">my company</a></li>
	<li>Engage more with my professional community (locally and beyond)</li>
	<li>Stay on top of the latest research on management of type 1 diabetes and the search for a cure</li>
	<li>Maintain enough control over my schedule to be able to accomplish all of these things</li>
</ul>

Happy New Year, everyone!
