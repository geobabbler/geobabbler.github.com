This past week, I got an e-mail from Jim Cannistra, Director of Data Planning Services and the [Maryland Department of Planning](http://www.mdp.state.md.us/home.shtml) (MDP), alerting me to a new product available from MDP called [FINDER Quantum](http://www.mdp.state.md.us/OurProducts/PropertyMapProducts/FINDERProduct.shtml). This product bundles Maryland property data and related products with [QGIS](http://qgis.org) software to provide users with a fully-functional, free-standing system for interacting with the data. It is designed to replace an older, custom software product, capitalizing on an industry-standard open-source system.

From the MDP site, the bundled data includes:

<blockquote cite="http://www.mdp.state.md.us/OurProducts/PropertyMapProducts/FINDERProduct.shtml">The product DVD includes the State's computerized property (tax) maps; the x,y linkages (point or polygon) to the Parcel, Computer Assisted Mass Appraisal (CAMA) and Sale datasets; Parcel, CAMA and Sale data, including Sale data via download from the Subscriber Website, from the Maryland State Department of Assessments and Taxation (SDAT); reference grids including a grid for the property (tax) maps, an ADC map book grid, a grid for the Maryland State Highway Administration (SHA) road, stream and feature maps and a grid for USGS 7.5' Topographical quad maps; and additional SHA files including a digital centerline roads file, data derived from SHA digital grid maps, an SHA major roads file and a county boundary file.<br/>
<br/>
Also included are land use/land cover data; congressional and legislative district boundary files; census geography and census demographic data; ZIP code boundary files; Priority Funding Area (PFA) designations; floodplain data, including DFIRM data for selected jurisdictions; protected lands boundaries; watershed data; generalized zoning designations; sewer service area boundaries; public water service area boundaries for selected jurisdictions; National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) Maryland coverage; residential Sales x,y point and summary files derived from SDAT Parcel and Sale data; large-scale, high resolution color digital-ortho imagery and a custom Quantum GIS project file (.qgs).</blockquote>

The MDP site indicates there is a [licensing fee](http://www.mdp.state.md.us/pdf/OurProducts/PropertyMapProducts/Finder/CstFnd.pdf) (PDF), which I assume is to cover the management of the data sets and the [license agreement](http://www.mdp.state.md.us/pdf/OurProducts/PropertyMapProducts/Finder/LicFnd.pdf), while acknowledging the GPL license of QGIS itself, seems to place the actual FINDER extension itself outide of any open-source license. (I am not a lawyer so I'll accept guidance on that interpretation.) That said, bundling QGIS with data that the statewide user community values and an application to help exploit it is a great way to get more users on board with QGIS.

To that end, users that choose to take advantage of FINDER Quantum will want to keep in mind that great [QGIS-related resources](http://www.esrgc.org/training/) are available via [Salisbury State University](http://www.salisbury.edu/geography/) and that training is also available from [Randal Hale](http://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=14036437) of [North River Geographics](http://www.northrivergeographic.com/introduction-to-quantum-gis). Once you have this powerful application installed, you can start to tap into a [deep pool](http://boundlessgeo.com/solutions/solutions-software/quantum-gis/) of [resources](http://www.osgeo.org/search_profile) to build your expertise.

So kudos to MDP for bundling their data with a powerful mapping, visualization, and analysis tool in QGIS. I hope that, in the near future, MDP considers making the FINDER application itself open-source but this is a great first step.
