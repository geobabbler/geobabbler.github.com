I had the distinct pleasure of attending my first <a href="http://2011.foss4g.org">FOSS4G conference in Denver</a> last week. Having not attended one previously, I can only rely on the opinions of others that this has been the best FOSS4G yet. For me, this was best geospatial conference I have attended. I'll probably blog in more detail about some of the things I saw but here are my high-level observations:

1. <a href="http://www.qgis.org/">QGIS</a> - I didn't attend many QGIS sessions but I didn't need to. It had everyone talking in hallways during breaks. Remember a few years ago when the desktop was the weak link with open-source GIS? Forget about that.

2. <a href="http://www.vizzuality.com/">Vizzuality</a> is doing great things to deploy usable mapping applications on the web with open-source tools. Every session   they led was standing-room only, with good reason.

3. <a href="http://vizzuality.com/cartoset">CartoSet</a> and <a href="https://cartodb.com/">CartoDB</a> - from the aforementioned Vizzuality. These open-source tools are designed to help speed the front-end and back-end development of a web application respectively. These are at the top of my list of things to check out.

4. One of the key characteristics of most of the open-source tools discussed in sessions I attended is that they originally grew out of the need to solve a problem. They were not just built on spec, hoping someone would find them useful. As a result, these tools tend to already be proven within the problem set for which they were built.

5. <a href="http://postgis.refractions.net/">PostGIS</a> - If open-source geospatial is a flowering field, then PostGIS is the water that hydrates it. The amount of tools that support it is staggering (including CartoDB). The importance of a robust, open-source, spatial data store cannot be overstated and the role PostGIS plays as a foundation technology is pivotal. As for PostGIS 2.0, Michael Weisman sums it up best here:

6. Javascript mapping libraries - <a href="http://openlayers.org/">there</a> are <a href="http://leaflet.cloudmade.com/">now</a> more <a href="http://2011.foss4g.org/sessions/geomap-%E2%80%93-new-open-source-javascript-mapping-api">ways</a> to <a href="http://polymaps.org/">get</a> an <a href="http://mapstraction.com/">interactive</a> map <a href="http://www.tile5.org/">into</a> a browser than I can keep track of. Those based on Javascript and/or HTML5 are proliferating like wildfire. The "I" in "RIA" now stands for "intranet".

I'm still organizing my notes and thoughts about what I saw at FOSS4G. It's impossible to describe the richness of the information that was available. The only real downtime I had was that which I sought for myself. I'll follow up these quick observations in the near future as I begin to dig into the new tools I was exposed to.
