This <a href="http://vistasmalltalk.wordpress.com/2007/01/17/autolisps-legacy/">post</a> from pfisk brought back a flood of memories. I haven't done AutoLISP since I last used <a href="http://support.esri.com/index.cfm?fa=software.filteredGateway&amp;PID=39">ArcCAD</a>. I thought the point made about leveraging concepts from AutoLISP for 3D drawings was an interesting one.
