I got a link to <a href="http://seekingalpha.com/article/71145-microsoft-s-savvy-open-source-move">this article</a> on SlashDot. It discusses Microsoft's effort to begin actively certifying open-source applications for Windows Server 2008.

I see this as a positive move. I use a lot of open-source apps on Windows myself. Many of my customers are still downright suspicious of open-source (I know) and achieving Windows certification will make it a lot easier to introduce them into some of the environments I support.

Of course, those same environments are just now upgrading to Windows Server 2003 so maybe 2008 certification isn't such a big deal.
