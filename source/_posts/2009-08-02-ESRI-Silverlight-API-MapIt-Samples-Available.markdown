I just noticed that the samples page for the ESRI Silverlight API in the <a href="http://resources.esri.com/gateway/index.cfm">ESRI Resource Center</a> has been updated to include samples for interacting with <a href="http://www.esri.com/software/mapit/index.html">MapIt</a>. I haven't had a chance to dig into MapIt yet but these should help you get started if you're using <a href="http://silverlight.net/">Silverlight</a>. (Which I am for one project. More on that in a forthcoming post.) The graphics layer sample is <a href="http://resources.esri.com/help/9.3/arcgisserver/apis/silverlight/samples/start.htm#MapItGraphicsLayer">here</a>. From there you can check out the rest.
