Hokie Nation has invited everyone to wear their school colors today as a show of solidarity. I will. You should, too. I work with a lot of VT grads. I have seen that their lifelong identification with VT rivals that of Notre Dame alumni.

So, from this Retreiver to all of Hokie Nation: My prayers are with you.
