Congratulations to <a href="http://www.paolocorti.net/public/wordpress/index.php/2007/03/21/ziggis-12-released">Paolo</a> for getting <a href="http://code.google.com/p/ziggis">zigGIS</a> 1.2 out the door. He's put a lot of work into fixing problems with selections and renderers and making it a much more usable tool.

His post contains a list of features implemented at this version and it's really a huge step forward. I am focusing on developing catalog objects but my recent upgrade to 9.2 has me doing regression testing on a lot of my code for my clients. Paolo deserves credit for really taking the bull by the horns for this release.

Those of you who are looking at the feature list for 9.3 and seeing PostgreSQL support should come on over. It's already here. ;-)
