Before I step on the plane to San Diego, I want to make sure I extend a hearty BZ to <a href="http://fantomplanet.wordpress.com/">Fantomplanet</a> for putting in all the work to arrange the UC Geoblogger Meetup out there. He's had a lot going on and this was one more thing he probably didn't need so: Thanks! I'll see you there.
