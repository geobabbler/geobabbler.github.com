I'm trying to wrap things up so that I can be ready to head out to Palm Springs. That's been somewhat challenging since I'm going on my fifth day with the flu. I've been watching some the <a href="http://www.spatiallyadjusted.com/2008/03/10/arcgis-server-rest-api-for-92/">developments about the ArcGIS REST API</a> with interest but, since I've had the energy level of a snail, watching is about all I've been up to. Things are looking up now, though.

Anyway, I hope to see a lot of you at the <a href="http://www.spatiallyadjusted.com/2008/03/10/esri-developer-summit-meetup/">meetup</a>.
