Tomorrow, I'll be heading up to the [Towson University GIS (TUGIS) conference](http://www.towson.edu/tugis/) with 500 or so of my closest Maryland geo-friends. It has been restructured into a one-day event and the program seems to be very content-rich as a result. I am particularly happy to see more open-source content this year. There's an intro session featuring [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org), [PostGIS](http://www.postgis.org), [QGIS](http://qgis.org), and [GeoServer](http://geoserver.org) presented by [Salisbury State University](http://www.salisbury.edu/). Salisbury was once known as a bastion of [Manifold](http://www.manifold.net/) so they've got a long history of thinking outside the Arc. Additionally, there is a session (by Towson University) discussing the use of [GDAL](http://www.gdal.org), [OGR](http://www.gdal.org/ogr/), and [Shapely](https://github.com/sgillies/shapely) in the development of a spatial service.

One thing I like about regional GIS conferences like this is that they tend to focus more on solutions to real-world problems instead of the latest technological bells and whistles. I spend so much of my time with my head in Federal requirements that it's nice do a reset and get different perspectives on how geospatial technologies are used. I am particularly interested to hear the keynote from [Learon Dalby](http://twitter.com/learondalby) of [Sanborn](http://www.sanborn.com/) and formerly of the [Arkansas GIO office](http://www.gis.state.ar.us/). I had the pleasure of working with Learon and the AGIO team on a project a couple of years ago and am impressed with what they accomplished.

I appreciate the new format of TUGIS as a one-day event is much easier to fit into the schedule. I'm looking forward to it.
