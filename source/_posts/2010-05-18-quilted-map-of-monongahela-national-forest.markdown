I found this map on display at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cranberry_Glades">Cranberry Glades</a> <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=38.203056,+-80.266389&amp;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&amp;sspn=38.41771,79.013672&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=38.202576,-80.266113&amp;spn=0.596777,1.234589&amp;z=10">visitor center</a> in West Virginia (click any of the pictures to enlarge them):

One of the rangers working there told me it is to scale (although the quilt itself lacks any indication of scale). 

The next two pictures are close-ups showing the north arrow and the use of buttons as place markers. The kids we are traveling with were fascinated by this map. You will notice a red box over a portion of the forest. That was the area covered by a relief map on a table elsewhere in the visitor center.
