As we enter the final hours of 2013, I wanted to take the chance to thank everyone who stopped by, and continues to stop by, this blog. I appreciate your readership, comments, and feedback. Even after 7 years, I am still humbled by the fact that so many read this blog each year. I decided to take a look at the top ten posts from this year, according to Google Analytics.

1. [Yes, You Need to Code](http://blog.geomusings.com/2013/01/30/yes-you-need-to-code/)
2. [GeoJSON on GitHub: Now What?](http://blog.geomusings.com/2013/06/18/geojson-on-github-now-what/)
3. [GeoJSON From ArcGIS Server](http://blog.geomusings.com/2013/06/10/geojson-from-arcgis-server/)
4. [SpatiaLite and ArcGIS 10.2](http://blog.geomusings.com/2013/08/07/spatialite-and-arcgis-10-dot-2/)
5. [Checking Out the GDAL/OGR Plugin for ArcGIS](http://blog.geomusings.com/2013/01/22/checking-out-the-gdal-slash-ogr-plugin-for-arcgis/)
6. [OGC Abandons the Web](http://blog.geomusings.com/2013/05/30/ogc-abandons-the-web/)
7. [DevOps for Geospatial Data](http://blog.geomusings.com/2013/07/28/devops-for-geospatial-data/)
8. [Another Look at GIS StackExchange](http://blog.geomusings.com/2013/09/12/another-look-at-gis-stackexchange/)
9. [Consider the 'Alternative'](http://blog.geomusings.com/2013/11/27/consider-the-alternative/)
10. [The Best Thing I Saw at TUGIS 2013](http://blog.geomusings.com/2013/03/20/the-best-thing-i-saw-at-tugis-2013/)

When I took a look at the list above, I realized that I have been much more focused on data than I have in past years. I think I kept a development/integration flavor but the focus on data was quite noticeable in retrospect. Though I have been actively coding all year, I notice that I did not have as many code-focused posts, which is something of a departure from previous years. 2014 is already shaping up to be a busy year personally and professionally so it will be interesting to see where that leads me on this blog.

Thanks again for your continued interest and I hope you have a fruitful 2014.
