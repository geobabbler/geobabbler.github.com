As everyone gears up for the <a href="http://www.esri.com/events/user-conference/index.html">exodus to San Diego</a>, I wish everyone a good, enjoyable and fruitful time. There's something to be said for the energy of 12,000+ geonerds in one place. As for me, I'll be <a href="http://www.childrenwithdiabetes.com/activities/orlando2011/">here</a>, hanging with a couple hundred of the bravest, most inspiring young people you could ever meet. After that, it's family time and and little R&amp;R.

And be sure to use the <a href="http://uc.dtsagile.com/">Unofficial Esri UC BackChannel</a> by the guys at <a href="http://dtsagile.com/">DTS Agile</a>. It's a great way to enrich your experience.

Have fun and, hopefully, I'll catch up with many of you at <a href="http://2011.foss4g.org/">FOSS4G</a>.
