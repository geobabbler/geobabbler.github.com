Last week, I did <a href="http://www.gisuser.com/content/view/22492/222/">a piece on GISuser.com</a> about the release of the new Acetate feature on <a href="http://www.geocommons.com">GeoCommons</a>. GeoCommons is an implementation of <a href="http://www.fortiusone.com">FortiusOne's</a> GeoIQ platform, which is exposed to developers via a <a href="http://geocommons.com/help/Developer_API">RESTful API</a>.

A couple of weeks ago, FortiusOne set up a <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/geoiq-api">Google Group for discussions about the GeoIQ API</a>. If you are using the API, or are merely interested in it, this is something you may want to check out.
