Just ahead of the <a href="http://www.gvsig.gva.es/eng/inicio-gvsig/">gvSIG</a> <a href="http://jornadas.gvsig.org/home/view?set_language=en">conference</a> in Valencia, <a href="http://www.gvsig.gva.es/eng/gvsig-desktop/all-versions/download/gvsig-19/downloading-the-program/">version 1.9</a> has been released. gvSIG is an open-source desktop GIS developed in Java. The new features in 1.9 are summarized <a href="http://www.gvsig.gva.es/eng/gvsig-desktop/all-versions/download/gvsig-19/version-notes/new-features/">here</a>.

Some of the new features, including SLD import/export, are pretty interesting. gvSIG seems to be flourishing a bit under the wing of <a href="http://www.osgeo.org/gvsig">OSGEO</a>. It's a tool that I have gone back to periodically over the years, and I'll probably take a deeper dive this time given some of the new features. I suggest giving gvSIG a go if you haven't tried it.

UPDATE: The gvSIG download site seems to be having some serious bandwidth issues.
