[Thanks to LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/groupItem?view=&srchtype=discussedNews&gid=3300945&item=242507385&type=member&trk=eml-anet_dig-b-pop_ttl-hdp&ut=12tcrQvogVeRM1), I saw that Dr. Art Lembo of Salisbury (Maryland) University is leading an "Open Source/Enterprise GIS Summer Bootcamp" at the university from June 3 - 7, 2013. All of the salient details, including contact information, [can be found here](http://www.esrgc.org/bootcamp/SUBootCamp.pdf) (PDF).

Having seen Dr. Lembo and his team in action [for an afternoon at TUGIS](http://blog.geomusings.com/2013/03/20/the-best-thing-i-saw-at-tugis-2013/), I think this will be a good way for those who have been wanting to take the leap with open-source GIS tools to get some hands-on experience with core tools like [QGIS](http://qgis.org/) and [PostGIS](http://postgis.net/). It's also a great time of year to be on Maryland's Eastern Shore. The LinkedIn discussion says there are still spaces available but the date is coming up soon so you'll want to move quickly if you're interested.
