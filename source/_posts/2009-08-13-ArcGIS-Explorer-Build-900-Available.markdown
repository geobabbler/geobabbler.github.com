Looks like ArcGIS Explorer 900 has dropped. It was pretty nice in beta and it's good to see that it's out now. It can be downloaded <a href="http://resources.esri.com/arcgisexplorer/900/index.cfm?fa=download">here</a>. The ribbon interface is nice. I've always liked the ribbon but I wasn't a fan of how it was unceremoniously dropped on us in Office.
