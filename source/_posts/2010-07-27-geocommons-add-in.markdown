Just a quick update on the <a href="http://www.geocommons.com">GeoCommons</a> importer for ArcMap <a href="http://geobabble.wordpress.com/2010/06/02/importing-data-from-geocommons-into-arcmap/">I blogged a while ago</a>:

There is now an ArcGIS 10.0 add-in available as a download from the Google Code site. It is available <a href="http://code.google.com/p/geocommonsbrowser/downloads/list">here</a>.

This should enable ArcGIS 10.0 users to also easily browse and get data from GeoCommons. Sorry, I don't have the add-in code available yet. I'm a little swamped so it'll be a while before I get to that but I wanted to make the download available.
