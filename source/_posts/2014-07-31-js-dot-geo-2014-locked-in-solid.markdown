A while back, [I posted about about the 2014 edition of JS.GEO](http://blog.geomusings.com/2013/12/27/js-dot-geo-2014-announced/). After that post, things got a little fluid, but I'm happy to finally be able to provide an update.

According to JS.GEO Organizer [Chris Helm](http://twitter.com/cwhelm), the event is ["locked in solid."](https://twitter.com/cwhelm/status/494919297144066048)

The event has a [web site](http://jsgeo.com), a location, and a date. [Tickets and sponsorships are available.](http://www.eventbrite.com/e/jsgeo-2014-tickets-12450450633) Agenda is to be announced and they are actively seeking speakers.

The first event was one of those serendipitous things that turned out to be pretty awesome. It was personally very influential on me and changed the focus of a lot of what I was doing with geospatial and with programming. It's probably the best single geospatial event I've attended in the last five years. The fact that FOSS4G will have already drawn a like-minded crowd to Portland should bode well for JS.GEO. My own attendance is still in question due to a number of factors but I highly recommend adding this to your schedule if you can.
