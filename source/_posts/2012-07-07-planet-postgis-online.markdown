<a href="http://planet.postgis.net/">Planet PostGIS</a>, an aggregation of <a href="http://postgis.refractions.net/">PostGIS</a>-related blog content is now online. As the name suggests, it is built using the same technology as <a href="http://www.spatiallyadjusted.com">James Fee's</a> <a href="http://planetgs.com">Planet Geospatial</a> but is focused on content related to PostGIS.

If you are working with PostGIS, whether as part of an open-source stack or in conjunction with proprietary tools such as ArcGIS, you may want to check out Planet PostGIS.

Thanks to <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/regina-obe/7/5/200">Regina Obe</a> and everyone involved in setting this up.
