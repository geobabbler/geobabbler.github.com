This came through my inbox. I thought it may be of interest to PostgreSQL/PostGIS/ArcGIS 9.3 users in the Pacific Northwest.



<blockquote>
Request for proposals: PDXPUG PgDay, due by June 20,2008

PDXPUG PgDay will be on July 20, 2008.  This is a one-day conference happening the day before OSCON at the Oregon Convention Center.

We are inviting anyone who has something interesting to share about PostgreSQL to send us a proposal!

We'd like to have at one 1.5 hour tutorial and up to five 45-minute talks.

We welcome talks in any of the following areas:

* Case studies involving interesting and innovative uses of PostgreSQL from an application developer, PostgreSQL developer or administrative user perspective
* Converting from other databases to PostgreSQL
* How-to accomplish database administration tasks (partitioning, backups, replication, writing stored procedures)
* Practical advice on configuration, monitoring and database management

We will notify submitters of their acceptance by June 25, 2008.

Thank you and we look forward to seeing you at PDXPUG PgDay!
