Things have been a little quiet (publicly) with <a href="http://code.google.com/p/ziggis/">zigGIS</a>, owing mainly to outside workload. For those of you who may be wondering, <a href="http://abegillespie.blogspot.com">Abe Gillespie</a>, the original author of zigGIS is now more fully engaged on it and making some updates. He should have some announcements in the coming weeks but I just wanted to float a balloon and let everyone know that it is moving forward.
