I'll be attending the <a href="http://www.esri.com/events/fedcon/index.html" target="_blank">Esri Federal <del datetime="2012-02-21T11:14:37+00:00">User</del> GIS Conference</a> this week. For various reasons, I'll be attending on the "Increased Carbon Footprint Plan" and commuting to and from the conference each day.

I'm looking forward to the reprise of the <a href="http://www.esri.com/events/fedcon/agenda/dev-geo.html" target="_blank">DevGeo</a> session this year as well as a number of the sessions and also meeting up with a lot of my geo-geek friends. I haven't heard the details on #geoglobaldomination yet but I'm sure it will occur.

I'll try to blog more during the course of the conference.
