Well, our abstract was accepted for the ESRI <a href="http://www.esri.com/events/feduc/index.html">Federal User Conference</a>. I say "our" because I am co-authoring with my friend/customer/former co-worker Dan Getman at <a href="http://www.ornl.gov/sci/gist/">Oak Ridge National Laboratory</a>. We'll be presenting some work we've (Dan, me and a couple of other really good developers) done together on the <a href="http://www.sensornet.gov/">SensorNet</a> effort.

I don't want to spill the beans here but we'll be presenting as part of the "Why Standards Matter" track. It's been a fun project and we've gotten to do some cool integration. So, if you're going to be at the FedUC, come on by and throw some vegetables at me (but try not to hit Dan, he's a nice guy). ;)
