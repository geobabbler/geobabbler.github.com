Recently, due to the machinations of contracts, I have ended up spending the vast majority of my time back on a particular customer site. This development follows a two-year period where I've been mainly working out of my company's offices on a variety of small projects. My new role brings me squarely back into the Microsoft and Esri realm in terms of system development and it has put me in touch how far I had gotten away from those technology worlds and how easy it was to do so. Without even realizing it, I had quietly gotten very comfortable with Linux as my primary operating system and development using Python, Javascript, a smattering of Ruby and some .Net ala Mono. And, of course, PostGIS/PostgreSQL have figured prominently during that time.
