Those of you following the progress of zigGIS via <a href="http://twitter.com/zigGIS">Twitter</a> may have noticed that zigGIS 2.0 is being released to the beta testers. This version features better handling of spatial references and well as enabling editing of PostGIS data using native ArcMap tools.

There's been a lot of code cleanup along the way and Paolo has build a new installer using NSIS. I will being developing the ArcCatalog objects again in the coming weeks, once the core product is stable (which is pretty much is now but it's nice to have others to beat on it for a while).

The <a href="http://obtusesoft.com">Obtuse</a> web site should become more informative in the near future but, for now, keep checking here, <a href="http://abegillespie.blogspot.com">here</a> and <a href="http://www.paolocorti.net/public/wordpress/">here</a> or follow along on Twitter.
