I got a surprise e-mail from <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/site/users/view/FObermaier">Felix</a> today letting me know that the <a href="http://www.gaia-gis.it/spatialite/">SpatiaLite</a> <a href="http://geobabble.wordpress.com/2009/04/11/spatialite-provider-code-for-sharpmap-09/">provider I posted some time ago</a>, along with <a href="http://">Kev's great spatial index work</a>, has been included in the <a href="http://sharpmap.codeplex.com">SharpMap</a> repository. If you're looking for one place to pick them up, now you've got it.

If you haven't checked out SharpMap or SpatiaLite, I highly recommend both.
