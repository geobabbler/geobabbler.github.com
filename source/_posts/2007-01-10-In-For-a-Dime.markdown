...in for a dollar.

I've been blogging about <a href="http://code.google.com/p/ziggis/">zigGIS</a> a lot (more than I had planned to, really). So, today, I joined the project. If you go to the site, you'll see "bill" listed as one of the project owners. That's me.

I had a long IM session with Paolo today and there's a lot to do. It's an amazing project that has a lot of potential. Not just for PostGIS but other data sources as well. This is my first time joining an open-source project so that'll be a learning experience for me as well. You can't be a lurker forever...
