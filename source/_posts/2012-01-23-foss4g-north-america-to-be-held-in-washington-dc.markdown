I'm quite happy to see (HT, <a href="http://blog.gisuser.com/2012/01/23/north-america-gets-their-own-foss4g-conference-in-d-c/" target="_blank">Glenn Letham</a>) that <a href="http://www.osgeo.org/" target="_blank">OSGEO</a> is inaugurating an annual <a href="http://foss4g-na.org/" target="_blank">FOSS4G North America</a> conference this year in Washington, DC on April 10-12, 2012.

DC is an appropriate place for this event because of the presence or arguably the single largest user of geospatial technology, the US Federal Government. I'm happy to see that <a href="http://twitter.com/Byrne_Tweets" target="_blank">Michael Byrne</a> is the keynote speaker as the <a href="http://broadbandmap.gov/" target="_blank">FCC National Broadband Map</a> has been a great success story in the use of open-source geospatial tools at the Federal level. I've been seeing more activity within the Federal Government recently but there's still a long way to go.

I know a lot of people in this area that couldn't make it out to Denver last year for FOSS4G. I hope many of them come to this edition to see the state of the art in open-source geospatial tools. I know this conference is targeted to North America as a whole but, if you are in the DC area and active with geospatial technology, FOSS4G North America should be on your calendar.
