Just back from vacation :-( and as a way of easing back into things, I have been tinkering with my <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/netframework/aa663324.aspx">WCF</a> project that's been sitting while the paying work has gotten done. It's the one that wraps PostGIS coordinate conversion as a web service written using WCF. My copy of "<a href="http://www.wrox.com/WileyCDA/WroxTitle/productCd-0470089849.html">Professional WCF Programming</a>" arrived while I was gone so I had some incentive. The purpose of this project is more to get me comfortable with WCF than anything to do with coordinate conversion.

Anyway, I have a simple WinForms client to test my service calls but I've noticed I need to clean and rebuild the project a lot. Suddenly, I had a flashback:

I'm using build and clean again! If only there had been an AML editor as nice as this one...

Oh well, back to work.
