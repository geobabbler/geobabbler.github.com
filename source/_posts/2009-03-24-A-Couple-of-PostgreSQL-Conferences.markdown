It looks like <a href="http://www.postgresqlconference.org/">PostgreSQL Conference, US</a> is putting on a couple of conferences in April. The first, East 2009, is at Drexel University in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania from 3 April to 5 April. The final schedule for that one can be found <a href="http://www.postgresqlconference.org/2009/east/">here</a>.

For those on the West Coast, there is PgDay at <a href="http://www.linuxfestnorthwest.org/">LinuxFest Northwest</a> in Bellingham, Washington on 25 April. Paper submissions are still being taken for that one so, if you think you want to present, check it out <a href="http://www.postgresqlconference.org/2009/pgday/lfnw/">here</a>.

Updates: Steve Citron-Pousty informs me (see below) that he will be presenting about PostGIS at the Bellingham conference. Additionally, Regina has informed me about <a href="http://www.pgcon.org/2009/">PGCon 2009</a> in Ottawa, Canada on 21-22 May, where her group will also be talking about PostGIS.
