It's been an extremely busy few months, as evidenced by the pace (or lack thereof) of blogging. I have been hopping between customer sites, mainly helping with ArcGIS Server implementations. We're also re-hosting an ArcIMS site for someone. I expect that to eventually transition as well but we have to get it moved first. I'm also working a pro-bono implementation of PostGIS/GeoServer/OpenLayers for the town of Green Mountain Falls, Colorado. That's been fun. It's great to see how a small town can marshall it resources (Boys Scouts with GPS collected trails as an Eagle Scout project) to get things done. The initial implementation will be simple as they are more interested in getting their data out there but then we'll circle back around to address public-service-type applications after that.

Significant changes are coming for <a href="http://pub.obtusesoft.com">zigGIS</a>. Abe, Paolo and I have been laying out a roadmap for its way ahead. Look for an announcement soon via <a href="http://twitter.com/zigGIS">zigGIS on Twitter</a>.

I have been having a lot of fun with the REST-based APIs from ESRI (Javascript, Flex, Silverlight/WPF). In particular, I've been happy with how extensible they are in terms of being able to support new data sources.
<a href="http://openlayers.org/pipermail/users/2009-June/012414.html">OpenLayers 2.8</a> and <a href="http://blog.opengeo.org/2009/06/17/geoexplorer-preview/">GeoExplorer</a> are also on my radar but that radar screen is getting pretty crowded.

All of this with less than a week to go before vacation. Whew!
