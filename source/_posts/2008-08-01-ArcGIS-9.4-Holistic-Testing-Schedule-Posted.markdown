In case you missed it, ESRI as posted the <a href="http://blogs.esri.com/Dev/blogs/holistictesting/">ArcGIS 9.4 holistic testing schedule</a>. The schedule currently runs through the end of April 2009 but doesn't give any hints of a release date.

So, just in time for the UC next week, you can begin to think about 9.4. If you want to get involved with it, now's your chance.

Hopefully, I'll see a lot of you next week.
