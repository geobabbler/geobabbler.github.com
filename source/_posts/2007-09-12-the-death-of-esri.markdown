...has (most likely) been greatly exaggerated.

I have no specific inside information but I do a lot of DoD work and I'm not seeing any massive shift away from ESRI. Sure, there's been a few instances of Google Earth appliances and individual projects using open-source tools but there's been no <a href="http://ubikcan.wordpress.com/2007/09/12/esri-cancels-its-books-loss-of-military-contracts-to-blaim/">dramatic sea-change that would drive ESRI to shutter its (unrelated) publishing business</a>. The whole thing seems a little shaky to me.

Just my 2 cents.
