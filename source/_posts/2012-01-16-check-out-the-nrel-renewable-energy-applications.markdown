Among the items in the category of "<a href="http://blog.geomusings.com/2012/01/03/sharpening-the-saw/" target="_blank">what I care about</a>" are renewable energy and open-source geospatial tools. So I was happy to rediscover the <a href="http://maps.nrel.gov/" target="_blank">various online tools</a> by the <a href="http://www.nrel.gov/" target="_blank">National Renewable Energy Laboratory</a> in Golden, Colorado. Many of the tools have been available for some time but the <a href="http://www.nrel.gov/news/press/2012/1681.html">recent announcement</a> of the <a href="http://maps.nrel.gov/re_atlas" target="_blank">RE Atlas</a> application brought me back to them. <!--more-->

RE Atlas is described as:

<blockquote>The Renewable Energy Atlas is an interactive mapping tool to allow users to explore base level renewable energy resource datasets. The intention is to provide a broad overview of available data and provide appropriate links to allow users to explore the data in greater detail.</blockquote>

I have also been browsing around the <a href="http://maps.nrel.gov/prospector">Solar Energy Prospector</a>, described as:

<blockquote>The Prospector is a mapping tool developed for the Solar Power industry. This tool is designed to help developers site large-scale solar plants by providing easy access to solar resource datasets and other data relevant to utility-scale solar power projects.</blockquote>

The front ends of these tools are built using open-source tools (<a href="http://openlayers.org/">OpenLayers</a>, <a href="http://drupal.org/">Drupal</a>, others). The interfaces provide a lot of capability, including query and download of underlying data. I like that the tools focus on making renewable energy data available to industry and private citizens for decision-making since uptake and investment by the private sector will be needed for renewable energy to gain lasting traction. These tools provide a good example of the potential for collaboration between government and industry to tackle challenging problems.

So, if you're looking for data related to renewable energy, these tools might be a good place to start.
