There is no direct upgrade yet so you need to remove the November CTP. Apparently, the uninstall doesn't always work well (hey, it's beta). Luckily, <a href="http://dotnettim.spaces.live.com/blog/cns!4B800EB59FAEDC2A!152.entry">Tim's post</a> straightened me out. This worked for me. More accurately, the guidance in Michael's comment worked for me.
