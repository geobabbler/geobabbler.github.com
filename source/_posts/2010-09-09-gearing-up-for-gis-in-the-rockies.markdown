I finally got around to finishing my travel plans for <a href="http://www.gisintherockies.org/GISITR2010/Home/Default.aspx">GIS in the Rockies</a> (personal obligations prevent me from making it out for <a href="http://ignitespatialnoco.wordpress.com/">Ingite Spatial NoCo</a>). I booked my flight a while ago but I had been procrastinating on the hotel and rental car. This will be my first time in that part of Colorado so I am looking forward to seeing the area and meeting people out there. NoCo is second only to the DC area in clustering of folks in my Twitter crowd.<!--more-->

I'll be giving a small talk at the conference about <a href="http://pub.obtusesoft.com">zigGIS</a>. It'll be part history lesson and part look-ahead and I'll try to address some use cases. In conversation, I find that people tend to see an "either/or" choice between zigGIS and using <a href="http://www.esri.com/software/arcgis/arcsde/index.html">ArcSDE</a> with <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a>. In truth, they can peacefully coexist and, depending on how ArcSDE is configured to work with PostgreSQL and <a href="http://www.postgis.org/">PostGIS</a>, zigGIS can augment workflows nicely. So I'll touch on that but I'll also explore how it can provide some flexibility in a maturing GIS shop.

Of course, I'll also talk about zigGIS returning to open-source at version 3.0. Abe is shouldering the burden for that and there's a lot to do, starting with choosing a license. We had some discussions about it and I think he's leaning toward the Apache license but we'd be happy for thoughts/inputs from others who've been down this road. Version 3.0 will be a major re-work of the code to address some of the changes that <a href="http://abegillespie.blogspot.com/2010/06/on-to-30.html">Abe blogged about</a>. It could be a while before something testable exists but it's an overhaul that's been needed.

All-in-all, I'm looking forward to the trip and the conference. Hopefully, I'll see you there.
