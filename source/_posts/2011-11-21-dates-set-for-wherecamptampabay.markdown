I just got word from <a href="http://twitter.com/tonyquartararo">Anthony Quartararo</a> that the dates for <a href="http://wherecamptb.org/">WhereCampTampaBay</a> have been set for February 10-11, 2012. That seems like a pretty sweet time of year for a weekend in Florida.

<div style="text-align:center;"><img alt="" height="375" src="http://www.qci-online.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/TampaPalms4.jpg" width="500" /><div style="text-align:center;font-size: 14px;">By February, you'll be ready for this.<br/><br/></div></div>

The 10th will feature an IgniteSpatial lightning talk session with the actual unconference happening on the 11th. I had a great time at WhereCampDC back in May and I know Florida has a very active spatial community that deals with a diverse problem set. I think this has the potential to very a very good event.
