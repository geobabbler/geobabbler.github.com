Maybe the warm weather has me feeling extra giddy. It seems there is no shortage of ways for me to get <a href="http://geojson.org">GeoJSON</a> and slap vector maps into a browser and I'm feeling extra happy about that today. So, thanks to the authors of GeoJSON for all you've done to help put the "modern" in the modern geoweb.
