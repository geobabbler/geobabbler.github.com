Okay, this really has nothing to do with GIS but I wanted to get this info out there. I have a particular piece of software that I use regularly that involves connecting a device to my PC to exchange information. This software does not work with IE7 yet. Since automatic updates doesn't really give you any choice in the matter (I love coming down in the morning and finding a new browser), this created a problem for me.

I found the following software that lets you install previous version of IE in standalone mode: <a href="http://tredosoft.com/Multiple_IE">http://tredosoft.com/Multiple_IE</a>. I imagine it may have applicability for testing and such but it also solved my problem.
