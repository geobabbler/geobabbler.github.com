James <a href="http://www.spatiallyadjusted.com/2007/12/03/2008-esri-developer-summit/">posted</a> a couple of weeks ago about he Dev Summit. That got me curious, is anyone planning on going to the <a href="http://www.esri.com/events/feduc/index.html">Federal User Conference</a> in DC? It's kind of mini East Coast UC. My company does a lot of federal and defense work so I'll be there. It seems to be attracting more people each year in general but especially those from local governments around the region that don't have travel budgets for San Diego. Rather ironic since it was originally targeted at federal users. 

It's actually something of an unusual year in that it looks like I'll be at all of the big ESRI conferences this year (FedUC, BP/Dev, International UC).
