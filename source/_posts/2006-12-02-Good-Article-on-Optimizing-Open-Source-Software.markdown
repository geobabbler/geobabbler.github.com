There's been a lot of recent buzz about open-source GIS software. Good discussions can be found at <a href="http://www.spatiallyadjusted.com/category/open-source/" target="blank">James Fee's site</a>, plus <a href="http://gispro.wordpress.com/" target="blank">Datum Shift</a> as well as on <a href="http://blog.davebouwman.net/default.aspx" target="blank">Dave Bouwman's blog</a>.

Given all of this discussion, I found this <a href="http://www.ddj.com/dept/opensource/193501014;jsessionid=ZNJIVAZ2NVHSQQSNDLOSKH0CJUNN2JVN" target="blank">article</a> in <a href="http://www.ddj.com" target="blank">Dr. Dobb's Journal </a>to be rather timely. It's not about GIS software <em>per se </em>but it's definitely relevant.

DDJ has undergone some changes of late but I still find it incredibly informative. That said, I still miss opening it up to find <a href="http://www.regdeveloper.co.uk/verity_stob/" target="blank">Verity Stob</a>.
