The second annual <a href="http://www.somdgc.org/Homepage.aspx">Southern Maryland GiveCamp</a> will be held on <del datetime="2011-01-23T00:42:57+00:00">March 25</del> April 1, 2011. Once again, it will occur on the campus of <a href="http://www.smcm.edu/">St. Mary's College of Maryland</a>. One of a number of GiveCamps that occur around the country, this one will <a href="http://www.somdgc.org/NonProfits/GiveCamp_2011.aspx">benefit several non-profits</a> of all stripes in the Southern Maryland area.

The concept behind GiveCamp is simple and elegant: "GiveCamp is a weekend-long event where software developers, designers, and database administrators donate their time to create custom software for non-profit organizations."

Last year's event drew volunteers from up and down the East Coast. The organizers are still looking for volunteers for this year's event. As a lifelong resident of Southern Maryland, I'd like to encourage my colleagues in the software development community, especially in the greater DC area, to consider coming down in March to <a href="http://somdgc.org/Volunteers.aspx">lend a hand</a>.

Having spoken to a few people that participated last year, I understand that requirements ranged from simple to rather challenging. Regardless of the complexity of a requirement to those of us who develop software professionally, the value of a working web site or database or other such thing to a small organization with limited resources cannot be overstated.

And if Southern Maryland is a bit far for you but you like the concept, there <a href="http://somdgc.org/AboutUs/WhoWeAre/OtherGiveCamps.aspx">may be a GiveCamp in your area</a>.

Thanks to <a href="http://somdgc.org/AboutUs/WhoWeAre/PlanningCommittee.aspx">Jim Pendarvis and the rest of the planning committee</a> for putting this together.
