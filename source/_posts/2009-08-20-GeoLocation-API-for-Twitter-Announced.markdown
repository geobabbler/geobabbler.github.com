Ryan Sarver <a href="http://blog.twitter.com/2009/08/location-location-location.html">announced today</a> the availability of a geolocation API for Twitter. It even supports GeoRSS and GeoJSON. This could be a potentially significant new step for Twitter. It looks like the API will be opened to <del datetime="2009-08-20T23:50:17+00:00">platform developers first</del> everyone (see <a href="http://twitter.com/rsarver/statuses/3437734477">here</a>).

Tying in location to the near-real-time nature of the Twitter timeline opens up lots of potential location-based applications. Let the slippy-mapping commence!
