Just a quick note to tidy up some loose ends related to recent posts... 

First, regarding the post "[A #LazyWeb Compendium of Python Resources for Beginners](http://blog.geomusings.com/2013/03/17/a-lazyweb-compendium-of-python-resources-for-beginners/)," the University of South Florida PyBulls Python interest group, as promised, compiled a list of Python resources and posted it [on their GitHub page](https://github.com/PyBulls/learning-resources). Thanks to them for their quick response.

Second, following up on the post "[The Best Thing I Saw at TUGIS 2013](http://blog.geomusings.com/2013/03/20/the-best-thing-i-saw-at-tugis-2013/)," the data and workbooks for Dr. Arthur Lembo's introduction to open-source GIS have been made available. The data [can be found on GitHub](https://github.com/esrgc/qgistraining) and the workbooks can be found on the [Eastern Shore Regional GIS Cooperative web site](http://www.esrgc.org/training/). Many thanks for contributing these resources.

These items are embedded in the comments for their respective posts but I thought it would be useful to call them out more prominently.
