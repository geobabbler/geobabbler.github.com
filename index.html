  <div class="entry-content"><p>In my work supporting various aspects of geospatial data modeling, I&#8217;ve spent a lot of time delving into concepts around configuration management of such data models. We&#8217;ve been able to apply a core tool set to perform various functions such as version managment, profiling, version-to-version migration, and validation in conjunction with a system we call the platform independent model (PIM). I gave quick overview of the PIM <a href="http://www.zekiah.com/index.php?q=blog/2014/01/02/generating-physical-schemas-pim">in this post over on the Zekiah blog</a> and the complete series on it <a href="http://www.zekiah.com/index.php?q=blog/topics/pim">can be found here</a>.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve recently spent a bit of time consolidating code after a recent data delivery and decided to post a utility that was an outgrowth of that effort: <a href="https://github.com/Zekiah/ArcGISCompare">a tool to compare schemas of two Esri file geodatabases and report differences</a>. This lent itself to general use because it does not require any connection to a PIM.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&#8220;Never make predictions, especially about the future.&#8221; - Casey Stengel</p>

<p>A few days ago, my friend <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=8637855">Atanas Entchev</a> asked me for <a href="http://geohipster.com/2013/12/31/what-will-be-hot-in-geo-in-2014-predictions-from-the-geohipster-crowd/">my thoughts on coming trends in 2014</a> for a feature he was preparing for his <a href="http://geohipster.com/">GeoHipster</a> site. Being the obliging sort that I am, I provided a couple and I&#8217;ve been attempting to explain one ever since. This has mostly been back-channel via private messages and such but, today, the GeoHipster piece was the subject of the &#8220;#geowebchat&#8221; on Twitter. Twitter is very effective for some types of communication but quickly goes off the rails where nuance or anything long-form is required. So, it was time for a post. My prediction went like this:</p>

<blockquote><p>I think 2014 will be the year Javascript takes over mapping and visualization in the geospatial world.</p></blockquote>

<p>It was followed by an apparently too brief explanation that I will attempt to expand here.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As we enter the final hours of 2013, I wanted to take the chance to thank everyone who stopped by, and continues to stop by, this blog. I appreciate your readership, comments, and feedback. Even after 7 years, I am still humbled by the fact that so many read this blog each year. I decided to take a look at the top ten posts from this year, according to Google Analytics.</p>

</ol>


<p>When I took a look at the list above, I realized that I have been much more focused on data than I have in past years. I think I kept a development/integration flavor but the focus on data was quite noticeable in retrospect. Though I have been actively coding all year, I notice that I did not have as many code-focused posts, which is something of a departure from previous years. 2014 is already shaping up to be a busy year personally and professionally so it will be interesting to see where that leads me on this blog.</p>

<p>Thanks again for your continued interest and I hope you have a fruitful 2014.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I got word today that <a href="http://www.esri.com">Esri</a> is planning a one-day [Developer Summit] in conjunction with the <a href="http://www.esri.com/events/federal/">2014 Federal GIS Conference</a>. It appears that the DevSummit will happen on the Wednesday immediately following the Fed Conference (which runs on the Monday and Tuesday) and will be focused on the issues and challenges that are unique to developing applications with Esri technologies for the Federal Government. I spoke with <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/jdbarry">Jim Barry</a>, who told me the DevSummit has come together rather quickly and Esri hasn&#8217;t had time to do its usual data gathering to prepare for such an event. As a result, they are canvassing the developer community for input on topics they should cover. Here are some things I suggested:</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Information about the follow-up to last year&#8217;s <a href="http://www.jsgeo.org/">JS.Geo</a> event has been percolating back-channel for a few weeks now. Now some <a href="http://lanyrd.com/2014/jsgeo14/">official details have been posted</a>. This year&#8217;s event will be held in April in San Francisco. I attended last year&#8217;s session, really liked the focused format, and got a lot of good information out of it. One thing that was nice was that, regardless of whether you are of an Esri or open-source persuasion in your development preferences, there was a lot of good information presented with a relative lack of hyperbole, which made it easy to focus on the content.</p>

<p>As <a href="http://twitter.com/geo_rube">Todd Barr</a> <a href="http://drunkengeographer.tumblr.com/post/69908102132/when-i-realize-that-no-one-who-plans-gis-spatial">eloquently points out</a>, the April 2014 calender is somewhat crowded with geo-events but, based on last year&#8217;s event, I&#8217;d recommend putting JS.Geo at the top of the list.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><strong>tl;dr</strong></p>

<p>This post describes the construction of a simple, lightweight geospatial data service using Node.JS, PostGIS and Amazon RDS. It is somewhat lengthy and includes a number of code snippets. The post is primarily targeted at users who may be interested in alternative strategies for publishing geospatial data but may not be familiar with the tools discussed here. This effort is ongoing and follow-up posts can be expected.</p>

<p><strong>Rationale</strong></p>

<p>I&#8217;m always looking for opportunities to experiment with new tools and the announcement of PostgreSQL/PostGIS support on Amazon RDS piqued my curiosity. Over the past six months, I have run into the repeated need on a couple of projects to be able to get the bounding box of various polygon features in order to drive dynamic mapping displays. Additionally, the required spatial references of these projects have varied beyond WGS84 and Web Mercator.</p>

<p>With that, the seeds of a geodata service were born. I decided to build one that would, via a simple HTTP call, return the bounding box of a polygon or the polygon itself, in the spatial reference of my choice as a single GeoJSON feature.</p>

<p>I knew I wanted to use PostGIS hosted on Amazon RDS to store my data. Here are the rest of the building blocks for this particular application:</p>

<ol>
<li><a href="http://nodejs.org">Node.js</a></li>
<li>Express web application framework for Node</li>
<li>PG module for accessing PostgreSQL with Node</li>
<li>Natural Earth 1:10M country boundaries</li>
</ol>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>When I was in college, I had a psychology professor who posited that you could train a cat (a dodgy proposition at best) to take a circuitous route to its food bowl by only rewarding that behavior. He was clearly a behaviorist and was convinced that you could completely condition the instinct to go straight to the food bowl out of the cat. To my knowledge, this professor did not own a cat and never attempted to test his assertion.</p>

<p>I was reminded of this after reading my friend Atanas Entchev&#8217;s <a href="http://blog.entchev.com/2013/11/22/some-post-postgis-day-thoughts.aspx">post in reaction</a> to the <a href="http://postgis.net">PostGIS</a> Day <a href="http://www.spatiallyadjusted.com/2013/11/21/todays-hangout-postgis-day-extravaganza-panel/">hangout panel discussion</a>. In his post, <a href="http://twiiter.com/atanas">Atanas</a> describes difficulty in convincing customers to consider open-source geospatial tools. These customers and prospects are comfortable with their proprietary tools and associated workflows and are reluctant to consider switching. I have encountered this attitude many times myself so I take no issue with the observation. Barriers to exit are real considerations, regardless of the new technology being considered. Organizations align themselves around their tools to achieve maximum efficiency with them. I discussed these issues at a talk I gave last year to the <a href="https://njgin.state.nj.us/OIT_NJGF/index.jsp">New Jersey Geospatial Forum</a> about how organizations can extend their existing geospatial technology investments with open-source technologies. These issues are very real for any organization with a mature, extended investment in a particular technology stack.</p>

<p>Atanas went on to liken the attitude to that with which some people view alternative medicine and I can see his point. Traditional GIS has set itself apart from the rest of the technology world for so long that users are generally conditioned to believe that GIS workflows should involve a series of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rube_Goldberg">Rube Goldberg</a> machinations involving file-based data sets, some proprietary scripting, and possibly some application-level business logic to relate and/or join data as necessary. This has taken various forms over the years but diagrams of those workflows tend to look the same.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It&#8217;s the morning of November 21st, but not for long. You open one eye. Just one; it&#8217;s best not to rush such things. Apparently, you finally came to rest in the ball pit you all made using the squishy globes from myriad conferences past. A cursory scan tells you the GIS lab is trashed. It starts to come back to you: the rousing game of &#8220;Pin the Certificate on the Khakis.&#8221; Yes, there are your pleated khakis on the wall with everyone&#8217;s training and GISP certificates stuck on or around them with pushpins. Someone won in what would have been a most painful way if the khakis had been on your body. The loin cloth fashioned from the old hard-copy topos (which you are still wearing). The fact that you let the intern talk you into finally opening a Twitter account and your glee at discovering you could attach photos to geocoded tweets with your BlackBerry.</p>

<p>You look around the room at your coworkers strewn across the floor. There&#8217;s the ArcObjects guy still sporting his &#8220;war paint&#8221; from the plotter toner. There&#8217;s your lead analyst with a face tattoo of the town&#8217;s land-use drawn in marker and, she proudly insisted, accurately projected in state plane. Slowly, you are able to account for everyone on your GIS staff. Good, no one has gone missing&#8230;except the intern.</p>

<p>The door opens and you turn to see the intern standing there in all of her college-kid resilience, letting in far too much sunlight for your comfort. You&#8217;re not sure it&#8217;s possible to hate anyone more in this moment.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, good,&#8221; she says, &#8220;you&#8217;re awake. Are you going to do the hangout?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hangout?&#8221; you mumble.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yeah, <a href="http://www.spatiallyadjusted.com/2013/11/18/postgis-day-special-hangout-this-week/">James Fee is doing a PostGIS Day hangout with a panel of experts on PostGIS</a>. I told you about this. I told you about <a href="http://postgis.net">PostGIS</a>. Don&#8217;t you remember? It starts in about an hour.&#8221;</p>

<p>It does sound familiar. You give it some thought. What better way to shake off the cobwebs from the bacchanalia of the &#8220;BEST GIS DAY EVAR!!!&#8221; (so says the hand-lettered Sharpie on the lab&#8217;s wall) than a little geo-hair-of-the-dog? Maybe it&#8217;s time to finally pay attention to this open-source stuff. You look around to survey the damage one more time. Besides, ditching the Oracle license might just about pay for this.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yeah,&#8221; you reply, &#8220;I&#8217;ll be there in five minutes. Close the door, please.&#8221;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In 2011, I gave a talk at the NCGIS conference about the continued dominance of the desktop in the world of GIS. In that talk, my main point was that, regardless of the ultimate destination of GIS data or maps (cloud, server, paper, PDF, etc.), most GIS data passes through a desktop GIS at some point. I don&#8217;t have hard data to back up that claim but I think anyone who has worked in the industry for any length of time will agree that it feels right. If we loosely define &#8220;desktop GIS&#8221; to include not only GUI analytical tools like <a href="http://www.esri.com">ArcMap</a> or <a href="http://qgis.org">QGIS</a>, but also command-line tools such as <a href="http://www.gdal.org/">GDAL/OGR</a> and cartographic tools such as <a href="https://www.mapbox.com/tilemill/">TileMill</a>, I think the statement is even more comfortable.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><iframe width="560" height="420" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/ljIQo1OHkTI?color=white&theme=light"></iframe></p>

<p>Essentially, my claim was that desktop GIS is still the onramp for most of the data we interact with on the web. Over the past few years, geographically tagged live and temporally-sensitive data streams have increased in importance but I think most geospatial data still starts as traditional data sources (rasters, vectors, terrain, etc.) that pass through a desktop for analysis, processing, and styling before moving on to the web. Esri, for example, still features its desktop tools as prominent parts of its web publishing workflow and <a href="http://boundlessgeo.com/">Boundless</a> is working on a <a href="https://github.com/boundlessgeo/suite-qgis-plugin">similar path for QGIS</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It&#8217;s great news that the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/house-effort-to-end-fiscal-crisis-collapses-leaving-senate-to-forge-last-minute-solution/2013/10/16/1e8bb150-364d-11e3-be86-6aeaa439845b_story.html?hpid=z1">government shutdown is finally over</a>. Many of our colleagues across the geospatial industry can now report back to work, ending a another stressful period for them. During the shutdown, many stepped up to try and fill the gap left by shuttered government web sites that would normally distribute geospatial data.</p>

<p>Among those who stepped into the breach are my friends at <a href="http://www.weogeo.com">WeoGeo</a>, who told me they saw a huge uptick in traffic as the community realized that government data sets such as TIGER and DRG are freely available in the <a href="http://market.weogeo.com/">WeoGeo Market</a>. One of the capabilities that has been quietly introduced into WeoGeo&#8217;s platform over the last few days is the ability to extract and download TIGER and OSM data directly in <a href="http://geojson.org">GeoJSON</a> format. The embedded video by WeoGeo walks through the customization and ordering process better than I can, but it&#8217;s great to have the ability to extract fine-tuned data sets directly in GeoJSON format for use in modern web-mapping tools.</p>

<p>Static content has been making a comeback lately, and justifiably so. The truth is that most of the content we interact with on the web won&#8217;t change over time and complex content management systems (CMS) that dynamically generate HTML and such from databases on every call are really overkill. Sure, there are caching strategies and CDNs and such to hide some of the misery but you can&#8217;t beat the speed, simplicity, and scalability of static content.</p>
