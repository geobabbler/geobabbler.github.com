  <div class="entry-content"><p>A year ago, I used the StackExchange API to facilitate an <a href="http://blog.geomusings.com/2012/09/13/carving-up-gis-stackexchange/">analysis of tags on GIS StackExchange</a> to see what people were talking about on one of the largest and most successful vendor-neutral discussion sites in our industry. In that post, I stated &#8220;It would probably be good to revisit this in a year to see how things have changed, if at all.&#8221;</p>

<p>Well, a year has passed so I decided to do it again. I used the same scripts and approach I used last time in order to be consistent. Since this is one year later, there is one key caveat. My analysis last year looked at the top 100 tags since the start of the <a href="http://gis.stackexchange.com/">GIS StackExchange</a> site. Since I ran the same query this year, the new results are compounded so what they so are last year&#8217;s results plus activity since then. Essentially, you are looking at &#8220;that plus this.&#8221; The pie chart below shows the breakdown.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It&#8217;s been a while since I&#8217;ve posted as the usual wind-down of summer and wind-up of the school year has had me otherwise engaged. What follows are few developments over the past few months that have floated through the transom of my geo-awareness.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://daylightdonutsstier.com/assets/images/slideshow/CakeDonuts.jpg" height="50%" width="50%"/></p>

<p><a href="http://geojson.io/">geojson.io</a> - Remember all of the attention given to the ability to render GitHub-hosted GeoJSON files as maps? Well, <a href="http://twitter.com/tmcw">Tom MacWright</a> of <a href="http://mapbox.com">MapBox</a> has, in fairly rapid fashion, given us this tool to edit GeoJSON in the browser and publish to either a GitHub repo or a gist. It&#8217;s an easy-to-use tool with an interface consistent with other MapBox tools. It&#8217;s definitely worth checking out and adds an important piece of workflow to the GeoJSON-on-GitHub concept.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h2>TL;DR:</h2>

<p>In which, as a result of a <a href="http://blog.entchev.com/2013/08/08/gis-blogging-in-decline.aspx">post by Atanas Entchev</a>, I postulate on why I continue to do this blog thing. This is a departure from my typical subject matter and you can be forgiven for not reading any further.</p>

<hr />

<p>My friend <a href="http://twitter.com/atanas">Atanas Entchev&#8217;s</a> <a href="http://blog.entchev.com/2013/08/08/gis-blogging-in-decline.aspx">latest post</a> on a possible decline in GIS blogging got me looking at my own output. After and initial surge, I have held steady at 40 to 45 posts per year. The discussion around Atanas&#8217; post, both in his blog comments and on his <a href="https://plus.google.com/110319601981109631300/posts/A3twyjrs8yL">Google+ stream</a>, got me thinking about why I continue to do this. So, at the risk of being accused of engaging in philosophical navel-gazing, here it goes.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="/images/posts/posts.png" /></p>

<p>This blog was not my first attempt at blogging. I originally had an <a href="http://www.esri.com">ESRI</a>-development focused blog on Blogger in about 2004. I think I made four or five posts, let it languish for a bit, and then killed it off. The main reason for that is that I wasn&#8217;t really sure what I was trying to accomplish with a blog. I never even backed it up so whatever was there is lost to the ages.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>With the release of ArcGIS 10.2, <a href="http://www.esri.com">Esri</a> quietly added support for <a href="https://sqlite.org/">SQLite</a> as a geodatabase container. This is big news as the community has been looking for such support for some time. An open-source RDBMS originally designed for embedded systems, SQLite has a very small footprint and is <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/mostdeployed.html">arguably the most widely deployed RDBMS</a> in the world. (Thanks, in part, to the fact that it is embedded into Adobe Reader and other commonly used software.) Over the years numerous strategies for storing spatial data in SQLite have been developed, ranging from simply storing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-known_text">WKT or WKB</a> geometries in a column up to full extensions like <a href="http://www.gaia-gis.it/gaia-sins/">SpatiaLite</a>, which adds OGC-compliant data types and methods. SQLite is also the engine that drives the popular <a href="http://www.mapbox.com/developers/mbtiles/">MBTiles</a> implementation used by <a href="http://www.mapbox.com/tilemill/">TileMill</a> and <a href="http://www.mapbox.com">MapBox</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There has been a bit of buzz the past couple of weeks over the <a href="https://github.com/blog/1541-geojson-rendering-improvements">ability of GitHub to render GeoJSON and TopoJSON files</a> automatically using  and embedded <a href="http://leafletjs.com/">Leaflet</a> map and <a href="http://www.mapbox.com/">MapBox</a> technology. This buzz is quite justified as it presents an easy way to simply publish and visualize vector data sets. In the weeks since the initial announcement, the community has begun exploring the limits of GitHub&#8217;s capability. Probably the two biggest limiting factors are individual file size limits and API rate limits. Some, including myself, are exploring strategies for maximizing the ability to store, disseminate, and visualize data within these confines. For the near term, <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> will probably not be the place to store terabytes of data or act as the CDN for a high-volume mapping application. That is perfectly fine and there is still a great deal of value to be found within GitHub&#8217;s current generous constraints.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="/images/posts/geodata-git.png" /></p>

<p>One aspect of GitHub (really, its underlying <a href="http://git-scm.com/">git</a> engine) that is of great interest to me is the ability to perform version control and configuration management on data itself. With GitHub, that currently takes the form of text-based formats such as JSON but it&#8217;s a start. In my experience supporting various customers over the years, configuration management of data has been a common gap in information operations. The most common, and inadequate, approach to this problem has been through the use of metadata. Almost two decades of viewing out-of-date, incomplete, and inaccurate metadata has given the lie to this approach. Metadata represents a separate maintenance workflow for which many organizations simply do not dedicate resources. Data-set-level metadata is also inadequate for volatile data sets in which individual records are updated frequently.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>While the majority of the geospatial world was at the Esri International User Conference in San Diego last week, I was at a different conference in Orlando, Florida. This was my third time attending the Children with Diabetes (CWD) <a href="http://www.childrenwithdiabetes.com/activities/orlando2013/">Friends for Life</a> (FFL) conference and I&#8217;ll be there as often as I can for the foreseeable future. It&#8217;s beneficial in many obvious ways; enabling us to keep up with the latest developments in diabetes research and technologies as well as keeping us refreshed in terms of diabetes management best practices.</p>

<p>The unexpected thing for me over the years has been how the lessons I&#8217;ve learned at FFL have begun to translate into other aspects of life outside of diabetes. (I do not have diabetes myself but I am a parent of a person who does.)  This year, perhaps because the ongoing Esri UC was somewhere in the back of my mind, it provided a different lens through which to view my approach to my professional activities.</p>

<p>The content at FFL is varied. Some touches on leading edge work in the field of biological treatments such as the <a href="http://www.diabetesresearch.org/BioHub">Diabetes Research Institute&#8217;s BioHub</a> as well as mechanical/electronic treatments such as the <a href="http://artificialpancreasproject.com/">Artificial Pancreas Project</a>. Other content touches upon achieving more effective day-to-day management using current techniques such as insulin pumps, shots, carbohydrate counting and the like.</p>

<p>The conference includes many pharmaceutical companies offering competing products, differing lines of research that stand a chance of superseding one another, representatives of government agencies, insurance companies and advocacy groups that can have very adversarial relationships. Yet FFL has an overwhelmingly positive tone. This because everyone is focused on one goal: the elimination of diabetes. Any approach that represents a step toward that goal is cheered by all, as is any technique that eases the burden of living with diabetes in the meantime. Ultimately, the various technologies showcased at the conference help facilitate progress toward this goal but the technologies are not the point.</p>

<p>Let me say that again.</p>

<p><strong>The technologies are not the point.</strong></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So <a href="http://github.com">GitHub</a> <a href="https://github.com/blog/1528-there-s-a-map-for-that">announced</a> that you can now automatically view any <a href="http://geojson.org">GeoJSON</a> files that may be in a repository inside an interactive map driven by <a href="http://www.mapbox.com/">MapBox</a> technology. This simple enhancement to GitHub is probably one of the most significant developments in the geospatial industry in years. I&#8217;ll explain a little later in this post. It&#8217;s also important to view this new capability as a great, but limited, first step. I&#8217;ll discuss that a little later as well.</p>

<p>While it&#8217;s cool to click on a link and just see a map, it doesn&#8217;t take long to wonder about how you can use this capability beyond viewing data in GitHub. What follows are three ways to capitalize on GeoJSON in GitHub. Not all are directly related to the new mapping capability, and two have been possible for a long time. That said, the GitHub announcement may draw interest from users who have not previously considered either GitHub or GeoJSON, so I hope these approaches will be useful.</p>

<h3>Embed the GitHub map.</h3>

<p><del>If you click on a GeoJSON file and view the new map in GitHub, a quick view of the page source will show that this map is embedded in an IFRAME object.</del> GitHub provides a <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/mapping-geojson-files-on-github#embedding-your-map-elsewhere">simple embedding method</a> to display the GitHub map in any page. (Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/benbalter">Ben Balter</a> for this update.) It&#8217;s a great way to quickly publish a data set while also providing access to download the raw data.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A while back, I posted about <a href="http://blog.geomusings.com/2011/11/15/fgeojson/">my desire to see GeoJSON supported as an output format from ArcGIS Server</a>. I found myself needing that capability so I recently completed, <a href="https://github.com/geobabbler/AGSOpenFormats">and posted to GitHub</a>, a first cut at a server object extension (SOE) for ArcGIS Server 10.1 that enables output of <a href="http://geojson.org/">GeoJSON</a> via an HTTP GET.</p>

<p>Using the SOE is fairly straightforward. If you download the code and build it (ensuring you have installed the ArcObjects SDK for .Net), you can simply move the project outputs to your target machine and use the ArcGIS Server manager to install the SOE. Once you log into the manager application, click &#8220;Site&#8221; at the top of the page and then &#8220;Extensions&#8221; on the left. Click &#8220;Add Extension&#8221; and browse to the .soe file. You should end up seeing something like this:</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Those are my words, not theirs.</p>

<p>It came to light today that <a href="http://www.opengeospatial.org/">OGC</a> has decided to <a href="http://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/discuss/2013-May/011789.html">withdraw the GeoServices REST Specification</a>, also known as the &#8220;ESRI REST API,&#8221; as a proposed standard. I will not take up the relative merits of the specification or the implications of OGC potentially adopting an industry-developed specification that has so much implied workflow embedded in it. With this decision, three facts remain unaltered:</p>

<ol>
<li>The ESRI REST API will continue forward as a widely-used de facto standard in the form of ArcGIS Server installs and other emulations, such as that in <a href="http://www.arc2earth.com/">Arc2Earth</a>.</li>
<li>GeoJSON will continue forward as a widely-used de facto standard in the form of numerous open-source implementations.</li>
<li>OGC still has no JSON syntax.</li>
</ol>


<p>Yes, twelve years after the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON#History">birth of JSON</a>, five years after the <a href="http://webhelp.esri.com/arcgisserver/9.3/java/index.htm#whats_new_93.htm">release of the ESRI REST API and its embedded JSON syntax</a>, and five years after the <a href="http://geojson.org/geojson-spec.html">release of GeoJSON 1.0</a>, OGC is still has no entry in the JSON space. Between Esri and GeoJSON, the utility of JSON in web mapping applications has been roundly proven. In the ESRI arena, find me anyone who willingly uses the SOAP API these days while the adoption of support for GeoJSON across the open-source GIS world speaks volumes. The industry has voted with its feet and its code as to what it prefers.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s probably a lively discussion to be had about where JSON should fit into OGC&#8217;s priorities. What is clear, however, is that Javascript and JSON are driving the web at large and the web-mapping space in the geospatial market. With no official stance of any kind in this area, it becomes increasingly difficult to take OGC seriously in matters of the modern web.</p>

<p>Howard Butler had a great point a while back when discussing the potential adoption of the GeoServices REST Specification:</p>

<div class='embed tweet'><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/JeffHarrison">@JeffHarrison</a> I think it would be great for OGC to ratify GeoServices. It would cement their irrelevance to current and future developers.</p>&mdash; Howard Butler (@howardbutler) <a href="https://twitter.com/howardbutler/statuses/331405667837542401">May 6, 2013</a></blockquote>

<p>The irony here is that the withdrawal of the specification accomplishes the same thing. I won&#8217;t go so far as to say OGC has no clue or doesn&#8217;t care but, in the perception-is-reality department, they look pretty out-of-touch these days. Is this a problem with process? Maybe. Is it a problem with message? Definitely. The message I&#8217;ve gotten from this whole episode is that we can keep doing what we&#8217;ve been doing with our web mapping applications because OGC has nothing for us.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.linkedin.com/groupItem?view=&amp;srchtype=discussedNews&amp;gid=3300945&amp;item=242507385&amp;type=member&amp;trk=eml-anet_dig-b-pop_ttl-hdp&amp;ut=12tcrQvogVeRM1">Thanks to LinkedIn</a>, I saw that Dr. Art Lembo of Salisbury (Maryland) University is leading an &#8220;Open Source/Enterprise GIS Summer Bootcamp&#8221; at the university from June 3 - 7, 2013. All of the salient details, including contact information, <a href="http://www.esrgc.org/bootcamp/SUBootCamp.pdf">can be found here</a> (PDF).</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"> <img src="/images/posts/river.jpg" /></p>

<p>Having seen Dr. Lembo and his team in action <a href="http://blog.geomusings.com/2013/03/20/the-best-thing-i-saw-at-tugis-2013/">for an afternoon at TUGIS</a>, I think this will be a good way for those who have been wanting to take the leap with open-source GIS tools to get some hands-on experience with core tools like <a href="http://qgis.org/">QGIS</a> and <a href="http://postgis.net/">PostGIS</a>. It&#8217;s also a great time of year to be on Maryland&#8217;s Eastern Shore. The LinkedIn discussion says there are still spaces available but the date is coming up soon so you&#8217;ll want to move quickly if you&#8217;re interested.</p>
