FEDERAL, MILITARY AND COMMERCIAL SPECIFICATIONS CANNOT BE PROVIDED BY DSCC. This solicitation is 100% set-aside for small business concerns. While price may be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final award decision will be based upon a combination of price, past performance and proposed delivery. The required delivery is 307 each in 120 days. Based on market research this item is manufactured for military use only and is not commercial; therefore, the Government is not using the policies contained in FAR Part 12 in its solicitation for this item. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item with 15 days of this notice. Users not having access to the Internet may contact the DODSSP, Bldg. 4/D, 700 Robbins Avenue, Philadelphia, PA 19111-5094.

The Contracting Officer may utilize on-line Reverse Auctioning as a means of conducting price discussions under this solicitation. During the course of the on-line auction, offerors' proposed prices will be publicly disclosed to other offerors and anyone else having access to the on-line auction. This public disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each offeror's identity will be concealed from other offerors (although it will be known to the Government), and only generic identifiers will be used publicly for each offeror's proposed pricing (e.g., "Offeror A"). By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse Auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the Reverse Auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307.]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[PRESOL - Ice Harbor Navigation Lock Downstream Gate Hoist Machinery Upgrades]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[Department of the Army - <p>The work described herein involves the replacement/upgrade of the navigation lock downstream gate hoist mechanical machinery and the associated electrical and control equipment, and the rehabilitation of the gate hoist friction sheaves.</p>
<p>Background</p>
<p>The Ice Harbor navigation lock downstream gate is a counterbalanced vertical lift gate and measures approximately 90 feet tall by 88 feet wide and weighs approximately 740 tons. The gate is connected to two counterweights (one on each side) with twelve 2-1/4 inch diameter wire ropes. The hoist machinery is located in two machinery rooms located at the top of the downstream structural towers, one on each side of the lift gate. The wire ropes pass over an 18 foot diameter friction sheave. The friction sheave is driven through an electric hydraulic pump driving a high speed hydraulic motor. The speed is reduced and torque increased through a gearbox having an external pinion driving the gear around the perimeter of the sheave. The wire rope passes over the uppermost surface of the hoist sheave. The two hoist sheaves support the cumulative weight of the gate, the counterweight, and the hoist ropes.</p>
<p>The downstream lift gate hoist machinery is the original machinery installed when the lock was placed into service in 1969, with the exception of a coupling (replaced in 1980), pedestal mounting system (added in 1980), output gear in box (reversed due to bent shaft in 1980), gearboxes and hydraulic system (replaced in 1989), hoist wire ropes (replaced in 2012). Electrical and control systems are original.</p>
<p>Summary of Work</p>
<p>Mechanical upgrades consist of the hoist drive components required to operate the gate, the overhead service crane in each machinery room, and the mechanical aspects of limits and controls for gate operation.</p>
<p>Furnish and install the following items for the hoist drives in each machinery room: new pillow block bearings, ring gears, pinion gears, pinion shafts, pinion bearings, couplings, and brakes. In addition, install new Government furnished gearboxes.</p>
<p>Install new bearings and ring gear for the friction sheaves in each machinery room. In order to replace the friction sheave bearings and ring gears, the contractor must have technical experience, labor, and physical plant required for jacking and shoring of the existing 18 foot diameter friction sheaves that weigh approximately 112,000 pounds each and the counterweights which weigh approximately 740,000 pounds each. Upon completion of the bearing replacement, the contractor will be responsible for precise alignment of the friction sheave bearings and the alignment of open gear contact between the new pinion gears and the existing friction sheave ring gears.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous elements of the contract include RCRA 8 metal based paint and asbestos containing material (ACM) removal and disposal from existing equipment, and reroofing both tower roofs with a liquid applied membrane.</p>
<p>The contractor will be responsible for gate hoist wire rope load balancing that will require the services of a qualified engineer with a minimum of three years experience with load cells and load monitoring equipment to ensure the loads are evenly distributed across all hoist wire ropes at the completion of the work. The overhead service cranes in each machinery room will be replaced with commercially-available four ton rated electric wire rope hoists. New overhead cranes shall be single-girder top running bridge-type furnished with pendant style pushbutton remote control and wall-mounted pushbutton control station. Structural upgrades consist of weld repair of the downstream gate hoist friction sheaves, fabrication and installation of new machinery supports and pedestals, fabrication and installation of new safety handrails, and structural modifications to the existing overhead service crane corbels.</p>
<p>Structural modifications to the existing overhead service crane corbels consist of the installation of an adhesive anchor system to increase the load capacity of the corbels from 5,000 pounds to 8,000 pounds. Evaluate concrete drilling locations for the presence of existing reinforcing steel with Ground Penetrating Radar or an approved equivalent method. Electrical upgrades consist of replacement of the machinery room motor control centers and power supply wiring and circuit breakers, installation of new variable frequency drive (VFD) equipped motors, new main power disconnects, new power distribution blocks, new VFD's, new control voltage transformers, new dynamic brake resistors, new programmable logic controllers (PLC), new network switches, new fiber optic panels, and new control relays.</p>
<p>New PLC installations require the contractor to provide PLC program development, licensed software packages, shop testing, and operator field tests. New VFD installations require specified hardware, programming software, onsite installation supervision by the VFD manufacturer, VFD test plans, and execution of performance verification tests.</p>
<p>New control panel, graphic panel, and equipment panel installations require specified hardware to be verified through Government-witnessed shop testing prior to delivery to the work site. A critical element of the project involves complex sequencing and coordination of commissioning and cut-over of new equipment and systems, and highly technical interfaces between new and old systems. The Contractor must demonstrate experience and qualifications necessary to manage challenging Quality Control and Commissioning programs for both factory and on-site testing requirements. The project involves long lead time procurement of complex electrical and control equipment and fabrication of large mechanical gears. Complete on-site work in close coordination with the Government lock and dam facility, and minimize outages and disruptions to operations.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[Department of the Army - CONTRACTING OFFICE ADDRESS <br>  <br> Army Contracting Command-Redstone (ACC-R), ATTN:  CCAM EX, Building 5303 Martin Road, Redstone Arsenal, AL  35898-5280 <br>  <br>  <br> DESCRIPTION <br>  <br> Amendment 01- This RFI posting is hereby revised to provide an identifier and to share the questions and answers received to date.    The unique identifier is W31P4Q15RFISCRS01 <br>  <br> THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY - Solicitations are not available at this time.  Requests for a solicitation will not receive a response.  This notice does not constitute a commitment by the United States Government. <br>  <br> This RFI is issued to survey the market for potential firms (both small and large businesses), with the capabilities and interest in participating as a prime contractor to provide services for any or all of the re-scoped SCRS requirements.  The requirement represents a portion of SED's overall mission to provide systems and software engineering life-cycle management support for various aviation and missile systems in support of the warfighter.    Representative examples include Air and Ballistic Missile Defense, Fire Support, Close Combat, Aviation, Command, Control and Communications, Interoperability, Intelligence/Surveillance, Embedded Systems/Computer Based Systems, training systems, training related game technology, Automatic Test Equipment, Automatic Identification Technology (AIT) and Unique Identification (UID), Internet/Mobile systems, and Personnel Performance computer or software systems.  In addition, SED is responsible for the development and deployment of the America's Army program which includes the public game, weapon systems trainers, and Army recruiting applications.   <br>  <br> The requirement has historically been procured as a part of the overall scope of the EXPRESS requirement entitled,  quote mark Systems and Computer Resources Support (SCRS) for the Software Engineering Directorate (SED) quote mark .  Previous task orders for this requirement, all under Blanket Purchase Agreement, W31P4Q-05-A-0031 with Science Applications International Corporation, were 0008, 0025, 0032 and 0037. <br>  <br> The follow-on requirement for the re-scoped SCRS is likely to consist of three individual systems service areas, which are described below.  It is anticipated that the ACC-R will process a separate procurement for each of these three areas.  A determination has not been made at this particular time regarding the method of procurement or the type of contract vehicle for each of these requirements.   <br>  <br> The three areas are as follows:  (1) Virtual Systems - consists of virtual environments and interactive multimedia, which serve as the primary driver of system performance and operation; (2) Battlefield Systems - primary purpose is to provide fielded technological resources to the warfighter on the battlefield within the designated area of responsibility including supporting systems and; (3) Strategic Systems - consists of operational employment, spanning multiple areas of responsibility, and  involving concurrent synchronous operations across combatant commanders. A draft requirements statement is included for each anticipated Area. <br>  <br> Each of the three areas will require performance of the following tasks/duties:  Program Management, Contract Work Breakdown Structure (CWBS), Review Audits, Contract Performance and Cost, Quarterly Status Reviews, Technical Reviews and Audits, Technical Instructions (TI) Management Plan, System Engineering, System Engineering Management Plan (SEMP), System Software Development Environment/Test Beds, Developer's interoperability Analyses/Requirements Definition/Tests, Developer's System Test Program, System Demonstrations/Operational Tests/user Evaluations, Software Development, Software Development Plan (SDP), Software Requirements, Software Design, Code and Unit Test /Integration Test, Developers Software Test Program, Simulation and Support Software Development, Software Products, Hardware Development, Hardware Requirements, Hardware Design, Prototype Development/Integration Test, Hardware Assembly and Test, Hardware Sustainment, Training, Transition Support, Software Fielding/User Support, Developer Change Control (DCC) Program, Foreign Military Sales (FMS), Non-System Specific Systems Engineering and Computer Resources Support, Senior Level/Computer Engineering and Technical Support, Developer System/Software Quality Assurance Program (SQA),  Verification, Validation and Accreditation (VV&A) and System Engineering Support to Acquisition. <br>  <br> Interested firms are requested to submit the following for any or all of the three areas identified above (Virtual Systems, Battlefield Systems and Strategic Systems).   <br>   <br> 1.	A capabilities statement including contract vehicle, contract numbers, and COR contact   <br> information to support the cited capabilities to include whether you were the prime or subcontractors on the referenced contract. <br>  <br> 2.	 A preliminary listing of current teammates/subcontractors <br>  <br> 3.	Potential organizational conflicts of interest, applicable to the respondent, shall be  <br> identified and addressed in not more than one page (included in the page count) <br>  <br> 4.

            <description><![CDATA[Department of the Army - The Corps of Engineers Fort Worth District is soliciting comments from the construction community addressing the potential use of Project Labor Agreements (PLAs) from large scale construction projects (exceeding $25 million) for the following project: <br>   <br> Construct Oxbow Valley Storage Sites A&C, Fort Worth, Texas, Central City Project <br>  <br> Project Description includes site preparation, earthwork, excavation, installation of prefabricated maintenance bridge, construction of creek (to include excavation for new creek alignment, aquatic features, riffle pools and runs, and retaining walls), construction of weir, construction of water surface regulator, construction of wet well, site restoration and maintenance, and relocation/removal/construction of a new access road. <br>  <br> Range of Magnitude: Between $25,000,000 and $100,000,000 <br>  <br> Some of the factors that may be considered regarding their use are: <br> a.) The involvement of multiple contractors and/or subcontractors working in multiple crafts or trades. <br> b.) The complexity of the project. <br> c.) Shortage of skilled labor in the region. <br> d.) Completion of the project will require an extended period of time. <br> e.) The use of PLA's on other comparable projects. <br> f.) The promotion of the Governments long term programs interests such as training of skilled workforce for future projects. <br> g.) The possibility of labor disputes that threaten timely completion. <br> h.) Additional costs from use of PLAs may be cost prohibitive. <br>  <br> A PLA is defined as a pre-hire collective bargaining agreement with one or more labor organizations that establishes the terms and conditions of employment for a specific construction project and is an agreement described in 29 U.S.C. 158(f). <br>  <br> Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Policy: <br>  <br> (a) Project Labor Agreement (PLA) is a tool that agencies may use to promote economy and efficiency in Federal procurement. Pursuant to Executive Order 13502, agencies are encouraged to consider requiring the use of project labor agreements in connection with large-scale construction projects. <br>  <br> (b) An agency may, if appropriate, require that every contractor and subcontractor engaged in construction on the project agree, for that project, to negotiate or become a party to a project labor agreement with one or more labor organizations if the agency decides that the use of project labor agreements will <br>       <br>     (1) Advance the Federal Governments interest in achieving economy and efficiency in Federal procurement, producing labor-management stability, and ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards, and other matters; and <br>  <br>     (2) Be consistent with law. <br>  <br> Reference: Provision: 52.222-33 Notice of Requirement for Project Labor Agreement Clause 52.222-34 Project Labor Agreement. <br>  <br> In consideration of the above factors, and any others which may be deemed appropriate, the construction community is invited to comment on the use of PLAs. Of particular interest to the Government are responses to the following questions: <br>  <br> a. Should PLAs be executed on selected large dollar contracts within the above referenced location by the Fort Worth District? What other factors should the Corps consider before deciding to include PLA provisions in a Fort Worth District contract? What type of project should or should not be considered for PLA? <br>  <br> b. Is the use of PLAs effective in achieving economy and efficiency in Federal procurement? What is the estimated relative cost impact, or any other economies or efficiencies derived by the Federal Government, if using PLAs? Will a PLA impact the cost of submitting an offer? <br>  <br> c. Is the use of PLAs effective in producing labor-management stability? Have labor disputes or other labor issues contributed to project delays in the local area? <br>  <br> d. Is the use of PLAs conducive to ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards, and other relevant matters? Are there instances where these standards have not been met on Federal contracts in the local area? Were PLAs used for those specific contracts? <br>  <br> e. Projects will require multiple construction contractors and/or subcontractors employing workers in multiple crafts or trades. Do you foresee any work on projects that may result in both the prime contractor and at least one subcontractor, or two or more subcontractors, employing the same trade? <br>  <br> f. Are there concerns by prime contractors on the availability of skilled construction labor? Information may reference current apprenticeship statistics and workforce age demographics. <br>  <br> g. Completion of anticipated projects will require an extensive performance periods. Will a PLA impact the completion time? What is the anticipated volatility in the labor market for the trades required for the execution of the project? Would a PLA benefit a project which contains a unique and compelling mission-critical schedule? <br>  <br> h. Where have PLAs been used on comparable projects undertaken by Federal, State, municipal, or private entities in the geographic area of this project? <br>  <br> i. Will the use of PLAs impact the ability of potential Offerors and subcontractors to meet small-business utilization goals? <br>  <br>  <br> Please provide your comments via e-mail to kevin.s.anderson2@usace.army.mil no later than close of business on May 19, 2015.]]></description>
