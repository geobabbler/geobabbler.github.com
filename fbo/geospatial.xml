            <description><![CDATA[Department of the Army - Request for Information (RFI) St. Louis District National Cultural Resources Services Contract.<br /><br />1. Purpose<br />This RFI is being issued for informational and planning purposes and follows on four previous RFIs posted on Federal Business Opportunities, FedBizOpps.gov (October 2014, June 2015, Feb 2016, and June 2016). Information gathered will be considered in order to determine the most appropriate acquisition strategy, contract type, whether adequate competition exists for, and the feasibility of an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Small Business Set-Aside contract to provide cultural resources support to the St. Louis District. The information requested will be used within U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Mandatory Center of Expertise for the Curation and Management of Archaeological Collections (MCX CMAC), St. Louis District to facilitate decision making and will not be disclosed outside the agency.<br />This announcement is not a Request for Proposal/Quote (RFP/RFQ) or solicitation of any kind. MCX CMAC is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals for this requirement. This notice should not be construed as a commitment of any type by the Government to take or not take any action. Please note that USACE will NOT be responsible for any costs incurred by interested parties in responding to this RFI.
<p>2. Background/Description<br />General: The St. Louis District is considering development of a national cultural resources services contract that would be awarded to qualified Small Business offerors.

All work must be able to satisfy current scientific standards for data collection, analysis, and reporting, as well as local, state, and federal requirements. <br />Additionally, conservation and curation services are required to manage USACE owned or administered collections.<br />In 2009, USACE St. Louis District MCX CMAC implemented a program under which a portion of the legally authorized curation work of the nation is being performed in such a manner as to also assist veterans in achieving both employment and training opportunities. The Veterans Curation Program was signed into law by President Obama on 6 July 2016 (Public Law 114-189). Contractors working on archaeological collections that need to be rehabilitated in accordance with the National Historic Preservation Act, the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA), the Archaeological Resources Protection Act, 36 CFR Part 79, and ER 1130-2-540 have combined teams of professional archaeologists and archivists with veterans to perform this work.

The MCX CMAC provides collections, equipment, and management, to implement the various program elements in cooperation with the Contractor at these eight locations. The USACE continue to investigate development of additional opportunities to rehabilitate collections using similar operating models, at multiple scales, to meet the needs of other federal agencies.<br />Required Subject Matter Experts: For future solicitations, the contractor will need to be able to provide the services of qualified professionals to minimally include individuals with the following capabilities/responsibilities, principal investigator, field and laboratory supervisors, archaeologists, laboratory assistants and technicians, physical anthropologists, paleoethnobotanists, geomorphologists, zooarchaeologists, architectural historians, historians, archivists, archives technicians, conservators, curators, underwater archeologists, art handlers and movers, graphic designers, and other varied professional personnel, crew members and staff. While it is understood that firms do not typically maintain all of these specialties, contractors should be aware that locating such specialized services may become part of their requirement for any given investigation.<br /><br />4. White Paper<br />Given the contracting needs of the MCX CMAC outlined above, interested parties are requested to submit the following information in the format of a White Paper. The White Paper should be concise and address only the information requested below. Please limit your response to not more than 5 pages; questions may be answered quite briefly. Again, this information will support market research activities within USACE. <br />USACE is proposing to solicit a single national contract for cultural resources services as outlined in a through z above.

The nature of the work to be performed includes, but is not limited to, providing the following: VMS satellite surveillance software and systems integration, VMS communication services, VMS-related materials and services, and VMS satellite surveillance software support and maintenance.
<p>The Vessel Monitoring System (VMS) is a satellite surveillance system which is primarily used to monitor the location and movement of commercial fishing vessels in the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) and international regional fisheries management organization (RFMO) areas. VMS supports law enforcement initiatives, for regulatory and statutory violation prevention, and for other fishery data-collection purposes. Data from VMS is used as evidence in the prosecution of many environmental laws and regulations including regional fishing quotas, the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (MSFCMA), the Endangered Species Act (ESA), and the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA).</p>
<p>The system employs satellite-based communications from Enhanced Mobile Transceiver Units (EMTU), which are on-board transceiver devices that certain vessels are required to carry. The VMS program monitors over 4,000 vessels 24 hours a day, 365 days of the year. The NMFS OLE employs software to receive, store, and provide to users (via embedded graphical map display, graphical text display or via export to common external data and GIS software formats) the location of those commercial fishing vessels that are required by laws and/or regulations to install and operate an EMTU on board their vessel. The software is used by OLE staff, the United States Coast Guard, State enforcement agencies, and other fisheries-related personnel, totaling over 2,000 users.</p>

OTHER INFORMATION:

Please forward all inquiries to Mrs.
 Elizabeth Carmack via email at elizabeth.carmack@navy.mil 

All prospective Offerors must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database (www.sam.gov) and the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) database (https://orca.bpn.gov).    The U.S. Government will verify proper registration in  SAM Database and ORCA to ensure offerors are eligible for Federal contract awards. 

Commander, Navy Installations Command (CNIC), has established the Navy Commercial Access Control System (NCACS), a standardized process for granting unescorted access privileges to vendors, contractors, suppliers and service providers not otherwise entitled to the issuance of a Common Access Card (CAC) who seek access to and can provide justification to enter Navy installations and facilities.
 Visiting vendors may obtain daily passes directly from the individual Navy installations by submitting identification credentials for verification and undergoing a criminal screening/ background check.  Alternatively, if the vendor so chooses, it may voluntarily elect to obtain long-term credentials through enrollment, registration, background vetting, screening, issuance of credentials, and electronic validation of credentials at its own cost through a designated independent contractor NCACS service provider.  Credentials will be issued every five years and access privileges will be reviewed/ renewed on an annual basis. Further information regarding NCACS is forthcoming.

Contractors should plan accordingly when personally delivering proposals to the designated government installation for a one-day pass access.
  Please ensure your company personnel or delivery service can obtain access to the designated installation to avoid delays and access being denied by the pass and id office.  Government employees are not responsible for and will not pick up contractor personnel or proposals external to the designated government agency or installation.]]></description>

Point Of Contact for this announcement is Ms. Allison Jones. This notice is posted in its entirety and hereby serves as the official solicitation for this project.
<p>CONTRACT INFORMATION: A-E services are required for an IDIQ to support the IMCOM BUILDER SMS (BUILDER) Program throughout CONUS and OCONUS. The contractor will be required to perform services in support of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) National Program Office for support of the IMCOM BUILDER SMS program customers and projects.</p>
<p>This announcement is open to all businesses regardless of size. This announcement plans to issue seven (7) Unrestricted IDIQ, SATOCs. The Government may award other than seven (7) SATOCs depending on the source selection decision regarding how many contractors are considered most highly qualified in accordance with Brooks Act procedures. The total shared capacity of the IDIQ awards will be $150,000,000. There is no set aside capacity for this procurement. Selection of A-E firms is not based upon competitive bidding procedures, but rather upon the professional qualifications necessary for the performance of the required services. Only firms considered most highly qualified will be awarded a contract. Multiple awards will be made from this solicitation. The contracts will be awarded for a term not to exceed a total of five (5) years. Work under this contract will be subject to satisfactory negotiation of individual firm fixed price task orders, with the total IDIQ contract value not to exceed $150,000,000 over the five-year life of the contracts. No one firm will receive more than one award as a result of this solicitation. Rates will be negotiated for each 12-month period of the contract. All interested A-E firms are cautioned to review the restrictions of FAR 9.5 (Organizational and Consultant Conflicts of Interest). All interested A-E firms are reminded that, in accordance with the provisions of PL 95-507, they will be expected to place subcontracts to the maximum practicable extent consistent with the efficient performance of the contract with small and small disadvantaged firms. Large businesses selected for this contract must comply with FAR 52.219-9 regarding the requirement for a subcontracting plan for that part of the work it intends to subcontract. Large businesses selected for this contract will be required to submit a detailed subcontracting plan during contract negotiation. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this action is 541330.</p>
<p>Contractor Manpower Reporting: The contractor shall report ALL contractor labor hours (including subcontractor labor hours) required for performance of services provided under this contract for the Department of Defense via a secure data collection site. The contractor is required to completely fill in all required data fields using the following web address: http://www.ecmra.mil/. Reporting inputs will be for the labor executed during the period of performance during each Government fiscal year (FY), which runs October 01 through September 30. While inputs may be reported at any time during the FY, all data shall be reported no later than October 31 of each calendar year, beginning with 2014. Contractors may direct questions to the help desk at: http://www.ecmra.mil/.</p>
<p>PROJECT INFORMATION: A-E Services for this contract will be used, but are not limited, to perform and assist the IMCOM to implement BUILDER assessments and supporting activities such as: implementation/preparation of sustainable infrastructure assessments, real property installed equipment surveys, space utilization surveys; real property inventories, building energy audit surveys, and Army Sustainment, Restoration, and Modernization (SRM) at US Army CONUS and OCONUS installations. These other services will include all types of comprehensive support for implementation and support of BUILDER at US Army Installations worldwide. The implementation and associated support will improve building inspections and facility management business processes. In accordance with DoD directive, IMCOM is required to utilize BUILDER which was developed by the USACE Engineer Research and Development Center-Construction Engineering Research Laboratory (CERL) to conduct its facility condition assessments. BUILDER is a software application for building asset lifecycle management. BUILDER stores real property building information and more detailed system inventory is modeled and/or collected which identifies building components and their key life-cycle attributes such as the age, material and capacity. Site Inspections are performed on the various components to determine engineering based objective and repeatable Condition Index (CI) measures which relate the general physical health of the asset. Functionality assessments may be performed to evaluate user requirement changes, compliance and obsolescence issues. With information about condition, functionality, and remaining service life, BUILDER guides the development of short and long-range work plans based on sound investment strategies, prioritization criteria, and budget constraints. IMCOM, through the Mobile District, had already completed a two phase pilot project to test utilization of the BUILDER tool at selected IMCOM installations. The vast majority of the work will be on active Army installations; however work may also include a variety of projects potentially on government leased property.</p>

The United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) <strong>intends to apply for approval of a Foreign Comparative Test (FCT) project (https://cto.acqcenter.com) to evaluate candidate systems.</strong> USSOCOM is interested in contracting with vendors who are currently using the most advanced technologies in the design and processing of 3D terrain data which, when used in conjunction with Integrated Navigation Systems (INS) can recalculate a platform's positioning based on geo-referencing passive/active sensor feeds. The system should also have the capability to enable detection of GPS jamming and/or spoofing by continuously monitoring the position from GPS and from the 3D database.</p>
<p><strong>The government may decide to acquire for testing purposes one or more vendor products that appear to meet or exceed the stated criteria. Further, based on the results of testing, the government may procure and field up five systems including 3D terrain data to meet military operational needs.</strong> Vendors must have adequate source and 3D imagery processing capabilities to warrant pre-production testing and limited procurement of test data. Responses are requested of those suppliers who can provide a working prototype ready for test and demonstration purposes on or about 01 November 2016 and capable of meeting the following criteria:</p>
<p>1) High-resolution 3D surface models that can be shown to support existing electro-optical and radar-based terrain navigation systems, improving navigational accuracy and reliability in GPS-degraded/denied environments.<br />2) Technology can be shown to contribute to terrain navigation systems and real-time precision navigation for manned and unmanned aerial assets, re-calculating the platform's position from the 3D terrain database.<br />3) Technology can be shown to improve accuracy and reliability through sensor-data correlation in next-generation INS in potentially GPS-degraded/denied environments.<br />4) Technology can be shown to process 30x30NM databases within 12-18 hours, meeting Component database resolution requirements and geospatial accuracy standards in USSOCOM Directive 71-3, Appendix B (attached).</p>
<p>Safety requirements are not yet defined. There will be significant safety requirements/standards which the vendor(s) will have to meet.</p>

<p>The Program Executive Office for Special Reconnaissance, Surveillance and Exploitation (PEO SRSE) is looking for companies with the capabilities to provide Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS), Non-Developmental Item (NDI), or near NDI systems to enable precision navigation in GPS-degraded and/or -denied environments utilizing high resolution 3D terrain databases. The United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) <strong>intends to apply for approval of a Foreign Comparative Test (FCT) project (https://cto.acqcenter.com) to evaluate candidate systems.</strong> USSOCOM is interested in contracting with vendors who are currently using the most advanced technologies in the design and processing of 3D terrain data which, when used in conjunction with Integrated Navigation Systems (INS) can recalculate a platform's positioning based on geo-referencing passive/active sensor feeds. The system should also have the capability to enable detection of GPS jamming and/or spoofing by continuously monitoring the position from GPS and from the 3D database.</p>
<p><strong>The government may decide to acquire for testing purposes one or more vendor products that appear to meet or exceed the stated criteria. Further, based on the results of testing, the government may procure and field up five systems including 3D terrain data to meet military operational needs.</strong> Vendors must have adequate source and 3D imagery processing capabilities to warrant pre-production testing and limited procurement of test data. Responses are requested of those suppliers who can provide a working prototype ready for test and demonstration purposes on or about 01 November 2016 and capable of meeting the following criteria:</p>
<p>1) High-resolution 3D surface models that can be shown to support existing electro-optical and radar-based terrain navigation systems, improving navigational accuracy and reliability in GPS-degraded/denied environments.<br />2) Technology can be shown to contribute to terrain navigation systems and real-time precision navigation for manned and unmanned aerial assets, re-calculating the platform's position from the 3D terrain database.<br />3) Technology can be shown to improve accuracy and reliability through sensor-data correlation in next-generation INS in potentially GPS-degraded/denied environments.<br />4) Technology can be shown to process 30x30NM databases within 12-18 hours, meeting Component database resolution requirements and geospatial accuracy standards in USSOCOM Directive 71-3, Appendix B (attached).</p>
<p>Safety requirements are not yet defined. There will be significant safety requirements/standards which the vendor(s) will have to meet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Responses to this market survey are due on or before 15 Aug 2016</strong>, and must include a product description with performance parameters and a statement regarding current availability, summary of prior testing, test reports of resolution and accuracy, and an estimated cost for the price of test articles and production units. Please provide name of firm, address, POC, phone/fax number, and email address. Submit complete responses to:</p>

            <title><![CDATA[SRCSGT - Geospital Cloud]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[Other Defense Agencies - <br />A. Introduction
<p>In preparation for milCloud 2 Phase 1, U.S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) is investigating the use of commercial capabilities to host unclassified geospatial data and provide related cloud services. The objective of this RFI is to investigate whether commercial capability exists that can host SOF-specific geospatial data and applications for FY17 pilot projects.</p>
<p>Based on the responses and feedback received from this RFI, program representatives may choose to meet with potential offerors and hold one-on-one discussions. Such discussions would only be intended to obtain further clarification of potential capability to meet the requirements, including any development and certification risks.</p>
<p>This RFI is being issued solely for information and planning purposes and does not constitute an Invitation for Bids (IFB), a Request for Proposals (RFP), a Request for Quotations (RFQ) or an indication that the Government will contract for any of the items and/or services contained in this notice. In accordance with FAR 52.215-3, Request for Information or Solicitation for Planning Purposes, the Government will not pay for any information/items submitted in response to the RFI. No determination as to the viability of this requirement has been made at this point and there is currently no solicitation for this effort. Any solicitation resulting from this RFI will be announced separately.</p>
<p>B. Background</p>
<p>Special Operations Forces (SOF) require access to SOF-specific detailed tactical planning data to support military operations. To meet this requirement, highly accurate 3D BIM, CAD, and GIS data is generated through garrison production as well as mobile collection in preparation for or during ongoing crises and contingency operations.</p>
<p>Dissemination of geospatial data is transitioning from local storage to thin-client based web services. In this model, USSOCOM uses open standards to share highly structured 3D geospatial data via web or cloud services. Using the internet as a transport mechanism means that client-server computing can be used in more situations, and more robustly, to provision SOF warfighters than has previously been possible. Emerging geospatial standards, data compression technologies, and transport also open up the possibility of updating data with expeditionary, field-collected survey information and tactical sensor data including geotagged photos.</p>
<p>USSOCOM currently maintains high performance computing hardware, end-to-end geospatial information systems, and structured geospatial data repositories needed to support web services on classified networks. The program office is investigating the feasibility of a commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) cloud solution to host unclassified data, services and applications. The objective of the FY17 pilots is to investigate the benefits and issues of deploying unclassified cloud solutions on commercial and / or government networks. Information collected under this RFI will inform a business case analysis and decision on whether the pilot projects could be extended and operationalized in FY18 and FY19.</p>
<p>Two primary concepts of operations below are of immediate interest.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Crowd Sourced Tactical Planning Data. Expeditionary collection of non-classified survey data to integrate with existing data products through an enterprise service-oriented architecture. In this CONOPS, the cloud service provider would host a government provided prototype web application, non-classified data, and services for disconnected mobile devices using Android and Windows operating systems. The mobile application enables SOF users to visualize and to upload user-generated geospatial content optimized for mobile (GPKG) including photos, voice, and video recordings. Data managers in garrison transfer field collected data to government networks and integrate it seamlessly into the gold dataset. Objective is to make more real-time survey information available to the SOF community.</p>
<p>Clip and Chip. Provisioning up to 300TB of unclassified SOF-specific data for access by tactical mobile users. In this CONOPS, the cloud service provider would push very high fidelity SOF-specific terrain and 3D geospatial data via services optimized for mobile or enable download to portable storage devices (SD card, thumb drive, external hard drive, or micro cloud server) that function on a tactical mesh network. Service would allow pre-loaded mission-specific data to be available during disconnected, intermittent, and latent communication operations. One objective is to demonstrate interoperability of data, services, and interfaces. A second objective is to investigate performance at the tactical edge, operating in disadvantaged and limited bandwidth environments. Government will provide an application that allows users to draw a bounding box within a web browser and download or stream open industry standard SOF-specific geospatial datasets optimized for mobile (GPKG and OGC services).</p>
<p>C. Request for Information</p>
<p>For purposes of this RFI, USSOCOM would like a COTS cloud solution that can deliver capabilities to authorized users in disconnected and tactical environments. Geospatial data is already critical for combat operations, but delivering SOF-specific data via the cloud is new for programs considering FY17 pilot projects. There is no incumbent.</p>
<p>Scope</p>
<p>&bull; The program office is seeking information for leap-ahead capabilities based on open standards and modular open systems that are deployable in a cloud environment. The goal is to field unique open source technologies that provide new capabilities to enhance SOF warfighter information dominance across networks, particularly highly distributed global networks.<br />&bull; Design approach for the efficient and secure integration and operations on multiple networks. Cross domain solutions are desired. Phased deployment:<br />- Commercial pilots in phase one;<br />- DoD NIPR network in phase two; and<br />- DoD SIPR network in phase three.<br />&bull; While initially focused on the two use cases above, the PMO is interested in the development of enterprise data services for consumption and distribution of SOF-specific 3D BIM, CAD and geospatial data across the SOF Information Environment. These cloud services would operate on both classified and unclassified networks, and should address cross-domain and secure mobile use cases.<br />&bull; Considerations that would contribute to lower costs of development, deployment, and operations.</p>
<p>Technical Requirements</p>
<p>&bull; Ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand global network access to USSOCOM-provided geospatial data and applications.<br />&bull; Ability to leverage open source, COTS and GOTS data management servers in order to connect SOF community of interest content and advance interoperability.<br />&bull; Highly scalable with easy synchronization of new data.<br />&bull; Role-based system (user, data manager, etc.).<br />&bull; Multiple methods for identity and access management. Users require public access, LIMDIS user and password, and CAC authentication.<br />&bull; Secure and compliant options for hosting and maintaining physical server based systems at the Contractor facility.<br />&bull; Operate in a commercial, DoD, or hybrid cloud based FedRAMP compliant network meeting DISA Security Technical Implementation Guides (STIG) mandatory requirements.<br />&bull; Up to security information Impact Level 4: Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI, FOUO)<br />&bull; Technical support 24/7/365.<br />&bull; Reasonable exit strategy to prevent vendor lock-in. No exit costs.</p>

The USGS requires the contractor to maintain, modify, enhance, document, and distribute software; reduce operational costs by modifying AQMS to use open-source database software and Linux operating systems; manage the SVN software repository; manage configuration and operation of AQMS software, installation of software updates, and administration of database; manage preparation, maintenance, and loading of current and historic station metadata, parametric and waveform data into AQMS database; and support its use at ANSS regional networks.

Earthworm is a seismic waveform acquisition, processing, and earthquake reporting system used at over a dozen ANSS regional seismic networks. It is an essential component of AQMS. The USGS requires the contractor to maintain and enhance software, create software distributions, and support its use at ANSS regional networks. Locations include Pasadena, CA, Seattle, WA, Salt Lake City, UT, Palisades, NY, and Menlo Park, CA, among others.

SeisNetWatch (SNW) allows seismic network operators to monitor the state of health of seismic stations. The USGS requires the contractor to maintain and enhance software, including developing data agents for new seismic equipment, developing methods to automatically configure SNW from AQMS metadata, creating software distributions, providing software support to USGS-supported seismic network operators and the Puerto Rico Seismic Network, developing methods to monitor up-time of individual seismic stations in the ANSS, to meaningfully report the up-time of analog and triggered seismic stations, and to aggregate individual station up-time performance into summary reports for a monitoring network.

CISN Display is a GIS mapping application for emergency management agencies that receives and displays earthquake information distributed via the Internet by the ANSS. The USGS requires the contractor to maintain and enhance software and data servers, creating software distributions, and providing user support and management tools.

Earthquake Information Distribution System (EIDS) is messaging software used to distribute and synchronize summary earthquake products among USGS data centers and ANSS regional seismic networks to CISN Display. The USGS requires the contractor to maintain and enhance software, including creating software distributions, providing support for data providers, accommodating PDL requirements, modify software as necessary to use QuakeML for data transport or StationXML for notification and update information on station changes

QuakeWatchCapOut converts earthquake messages distributed through EIDS and PDL into the Common Alerting Protocol (CAP) format and forwards CAP messages to the Disaster Management Interoperability Services (DMIS) server and as a USGS RSS feed. Support is needed to implement updates of the CAP protocol. 

ShakeAlertToCAP converts earthquake early warning messages from the ShakeAlert system into the CAP format  for distribution over various emergency alert systems, including FEMA's IPAWS-OPEN.  Support will be needed to continue to enhance and maintain this software to provide information on expected shaking intensity as the ShakeAlert system evolves.

geoJSON2ew is  a software module that converts geoJSON format to the Earthworm tracebuf format.  It is used in the ShakeAlert earthquake early warning system to import GPS datastreams for use in the ShakeAlert system.  The USGS requires the contractor to maintain and enhance this module as needed to support the incorporation of GPS data within the ShakeAlert system.

CESMD Virtual Data Center (VDC) hosts a database of global strong-motion waveform data and derived products for use by the engineering community that is accessible via the web. The VDC is a cooperative effort between the California Geological Survey and the USGS. The USGS requires the contractor to develop tools to efficiently retrieve strong motion data from non-US seismic networks and incorporate those data into the CESMD.

OpenSHM is structural health monitoring software that process recorded data by the seismic arrays installed in structures in real time to track changes in the dynamic characteristics of the structure and detect damage as it occurs, and issue warning messages.

SWARM (Seismic Wave Analysis and Real-time Monitor) is a Java program to analyze seismic waveforms in real-time that can display helicorders, frequency spectra, and spectrograms for visualizing seismic waveforms quickly and effectively.

Winston is a Java program that replaces the Earthworm wave_server5. It uses an SQL database, automatically compresses data, eliminates wave tanks, has no size limitations or limits on stored duration, and handles out of order tracebufs seamlessly.

            <title><![CDATA[SRCSGT - Sources Sought for Construction of the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) Next NGA West (N2W) program.]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[Department of the Army - Sources Sought for Construction of the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) Next NGA West (N2W) program.<br />&nbsp;<br />The following is a Sources Sought Notice. This Sources Sought announcement is for market research information only and is to be used for preliminary planning purposes and for determining the acquisition approach. No proposals are being requested and none will be accepted in response to this notice. THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR PROPOSALS AND NO CONTRACT WILL BE AWARDED FROM THIS NOTICE. The purpose of this notice is to gain knowledge of interest and capabilities of various members of industry, to include the Small Business Community, for Commercial and Institutional Building Construction in the St Louis, MO metropolitan area. This effort is classified through the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) under 236220 Commercial and Institutional building Construction. ($36.5M Small Business size standard)<br /><br />It is anticipated that a solicitation announcement will be published on the Federal Business Opportunities website late in Fiscal year 2016 or early Fiscal year 2017. In accordance with FAR 36/DFARs 236, the estimated construction price range for this project is over $500,000,000 with an estimated construction duration of 4+ years.<br />&nbsp;<br />The US Army Corps of Engineers, Kansas City District is seeking contractors to execute a competitive, firm-fixed price, Design-Build contract for the construction of a replacement facility for the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency's (NGA) 2nd Street, St. Louis facility, as part of the N2W program. This design-build procurement is anticipated to use Two-Phase Design-Build Selection Procedures in accordance with FAR 36.3. Phase one will result in the selection of 2 - 3 firms invited to submit a proposal in Phase two. Phase two submittals will include a price proposal and a technical proposal including design concepts and proposed technical solutions.<br />&nbsp;<br />The completed N2W will result in a secure facility constructed in accordance with Intelligence Community Directive (ICD) 705. Some key design personnel on the design-build team may be required to have various levels of active security clearances. <br />All Offerors and subcontractors shall be required to comply with DFARS 252.225-7050, Disclosure of ownership or control by the government of a country that is a state sponsor of terrorism, DFARS 252.209-7002, Disclosure of Ownership or Control by a Foreign Government and DFARS 252.209-7004, Subcontracting with firms that are owned or controlled by the government of a country that is a state sponsor of terrorism.<br /><br />A contract will not be awarded to a firm or subsidiary of a firm if it is determined that the Government of a terrorist country has significant interest in the firm or subsidiary or if the firm is determined to be under foreign ownership of a country that sponsors or assists terrorism or is an intelligence threat. Subcontracts identified in the proposal are subject to the same eligibility determination.<br /><br />The project is tentatively programmed for construction in FY18 through FY22. The project may include some of the following facilities/improvements:<br /><br />a. Main Operations Building (approx 800,000 sf)<br />b. Central Utilities Plant (approx 38,000 sf)<br />c. Structured Parking (approx 1,000,000 sf)<br />d. Visit Control Center (VCC) (approx 7,300 sf)<br />e. Remote Vehicle/Truck Inspection Facility (approx 6,500 sf)<br />f. Associated Site improvements (roads, utilities, perimeter fence, landscaping, access control points, etc)<br />g. Installation of Furniture Fixtures and Equipment (FF&amp;E) as well as Passive Information Technology (IT) cabling.<br />h. Temporary Integrated Program Office (IPO) <br /><br />N2W Requirement: The N2W facility is required to replace mission critical facilities in St. Louis that have exceeded their service life. The project will accommodate new technologies and processes that will generate beneficial synergies through integration, collaboration, and geospatial data immersion. The &lsquo;purpose-built' facility will provide an open flexible work environment that is scalable, reconfigurable, and adaptive to changing mission requirements and the associated changes in workflow and data sharing methodologies. The project will provide NGA's workforce with safe, secure, and efficient facilities that will meet the agency's long-term requirements and vision for Geospatial-Intelligence (GEOINT) and will be consistent with the Director National Intelligence (DNI) facilities strategic plan. Given the scale of the construction project and the need for NGA to move from existing facilities minimizing dual operating costs, the N2W will require the builder to provide transition phase services from immediately after beneficial occupancy date (BOD) for up to 24 months later when the facility will be ready for full operational capability (FOC). <br /><br />The Kansas City District is soliciting feedback from industry (both Large and Small Businesses) as part of our market research efforts associated with this acquisition. The following information is requested in this Sources Sought (SS) announcement with a limit of fifteen (15) pages for your response: Please respond to the appropriate section below.

The US Army Corps of Engineers, Army Geospatial Center (AGC), is issuing this Request for Information (RFI) / Sources Sought to perform market research in order to determine the availability of firms which possess the capability to execute the requirements in the attached draft Performance Work Statement (PWS). No proposals are being requested or accepted in response to this RFI. This announcement does not obligate the Government to award a contract, nor does it obligate the Government to pay for any preparation costs.
<p>Requirement:</p>
<p>The anticipated formal solicitation is for an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Multiple Award Task Order Contract (MATOC) with a maximum value of $48.5M, over a five year ordering period. This RFI/Sources Sought is NOT a request for proposals, nor does it restrict the Government as to the ultimate acquisition approach. Therefore, we invite any size business concerns to provide a capability statement in response to this RFI/Sources Sought.</p>
<p>The AGC has a world-wide requirement. There is a need to acquire special skill sets, systems engineering, and technical services to accomplish its mission, which is to coordinate, integrate and synchronize geospatial information requirements and standards across the Army; develop and field geospatial-enterprise enabled systems and capabilities to the Army and the Department of Defense; and to provide direct geospatial support and product to the Installations, Energy &amp; Environment community.

The anticipated North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) for these requirements is 541512. The business size standard for this NAICS is $27.5M. Your response should identify your business size (large or small) in relation to this NAICS Code.</p>
<p>Security Requirements:</p>
<p>This is an unclassified contract. Because of the nature of the work involved and the extensive access to Army information technology (IT) systems containing sensitive data, all Contractor personnel performing System Administrative functions must have a Secret clearance.</p>
<p>Capabilities Package:</p>
<p>AGC is seeking a Prime capable of providing all the services listed as items 5.1 through 5.6 in the draft PWS, independently or through the use of Subcontractors and/or partners. At a minimum, the Prime must demonstrate the capability to independently provide the services listed as items 5.1, 5.3, 5.5, and 5.6. The Prime may employ Subcontractors and/or Partners for the remaining services, items 5.2 and 5.4. Interested sources shall possess and demonstrate an in-depth understanding of all the requirements listed in the draft PWS items 5.1 through 5.6. Responses are limited to no more than 10 pages, consisting of font size 12 and must demonstrate the ability to provide the specific required services identified in the draft PWS sections 5.1 through 5.6.

Respondents shall list any relevant work by specific contract number to allow for review.</p>
<p>Responses:</p>
<p>The information provided in the RFI is subject to change and does not bind the Government. Interested sources are discouraged from submitting commercial literature in response to this RFI. Any submissions of such product literature or catalog cut sheets will be treated separate from, and will have no bearing on, any subsequent evaluation of proposals submitted in response to any resulting future formal Request for Proposals (RFP). AGC has not made a commitment to procure any of the products or services discussed, and the release of this RFI should not be construed as such a commitment or as authorization to incur cost for which reimbursement would be required or sought. AGC will not pay for information or comments provided and will not recognize any costs associated with submission of comments. All submissions become Government property and will not be returned. RESPONSES ARE DUE NO LATER THAN 9 JUNE 2016, 12:00 PM, EST.

            <description><![CDATA[National Aeronautics and Space Administration - ***Please contact Sharrief Alamin, only, in writing at sharrief.a.alamin@nasa.gov for technical concerns***
<p>NASA/MSFC plans to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) for a strategic impact evaluation to ascertain the impact, value, and effectiveness of SERVIR applied science activities. The study will focus on using new innovative methods/approaches to value, measure and quantify the benefits of NASA data products/tools and scientific efforts on societal benefits.</p>
<p>To improve National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA's) understanding on the impact, value, and effectiveness of SERVIR Applied Sciences activities, NASA/ Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) has a requirement to conduct a strategic impact evaluation. The study will focus on using new innovative methods/approaches to value, measure and quantify the benefits of NASA data products/tools and scientific efforts on societal benefits.</p>
<p>In 2012, NASA Applied Sciences Program created 11 PI-led SERVIR Applied Sciences Team (AST) projects. These were focused across various societal areas including water, disasters, agriculture, public health and climate change. Currently, NASA is in the process of designing a potential second round for AST work. Understanding the benefits and contribution to SERVIR outcomes and impacts from the first AST cohort is critical in ensuring the second round also is successful. In addition, identifying ways to improve and maximize the effectiveness of PI-led scientific teams for development goals, will ensure NASA funding is meeting its intended mission.</p>
<p>The 2012-funded SERVIR AST projects are in a third year of work of their four-year project term. Many projects are building tools products and applications to help communities manage natural disasters, increase resilience to climate change, and predict environmental events (fire, floods, droughts, and landslides). Using some of the most advanced data, products and models in the globe, these scientists are harnessing NASA products to help improve access to data, use of geospatial information for decision making, and increase geospatial information capacity in developing regions. The AST projects are just one example of many efforts that use NASA's portfolio of data, products, and tools to help improve the lives of people.</p>
<p>The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. The NAICS Code and Size Standard are 541712 and 500, respectively.</p>
<p>All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.</p>
<p>The anticipated release date of the RFP is on or about April 13, 2016 with an anticipated offer due date of on or about May 12, 2016.</p>
<p>Prospective offerors shall notify this office of their intent to submit an offer. It is the offeror's responsibility to monitor the Internet site for the release of the solicitation and amendments (if any). Potential offerors will be responsible for downloading their own copy of the solicitation and amendments (if any).</p>
<p>All contractual technical questions must be submitted in writing (e-mail or fax). Telephone questions will not be accepted.</p>]]></description>

OTHER INFORMATION:

Please forward all inquiries to Mrs.
 Elizabeth Carmack via email at elizabeth.carmack@navy.mil 

All prospective Offerors must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database (www.sam.gov) and the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) database (https://orca.bpn.gov).    The U.S. Government will verify proper registration in  SAM Database and ORCA to ensure offerors are eligible for Federal contract awards. 

Commander, Navy Installations Command (CNIC), has established the Navy Commercial Access Control System (NCACS), a standardized process for granting unescorted access privileges to vendors, contractors, suppliers and service providers not otherwise entitled to the issuance of a Common Access Card (CAC) who seek access to and can provide justification to enter Navy installations and facilities.
 Visiting vendors may obtain daily passes directly from the individual Navy installations by submitting identification credentials for verification and undergoing a criminal screening/ background check.  Alternatively, if the vendor so chooses, it may voluntarily elect to obtain long-term credentials through enrollment, registration, background vetting, screening, issuance of credentials, and electronic validation of credentials at its own cost through a designated independent contractor NCACS service provider.  Credentials will be issued every five years and access privileges will be reviewed/ renewed on an annual basis. Further information regarding NCACS is forthcoming.

Contractors should plan accordingly when personally delivering proposals to the designated government installation for a one-day pass access.
  Please ensure your company personnel or delivery service can obtain access to the designated installation to avoid delays and access being denied by the pass and id office.  Government employees are not responsible for and will not pick up contractor personnel or proposals external to the designated government agency or installation.]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[SRCSGT - Subject Matter Expert Services for Mosul Dam, Nineveh Governorate, Iraq]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[Department of the Army - Agency: Department of the Army&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 11 April 2016<br />Office: U.S. Army Corps of Engineers<br />Location: USACE Middle East District
<p>Solicitation Number: W912ER-16-R-0023<br />Notice Type: Sources Sought<br />Synopsis:</p>
<p>1. This is a Sources Sought Notice only. This is not a Solicitation Announcement, nor is it a Request for Proposal. This request does not obligate the Government in any contract award. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Transatlantic Middle East District (TAM) is conducting preliminary research to determine the market capabilities (of both large and small firms) to provide Architectural and Engineering (A-E) Services in support of the USACE performing engineering and oversight of foundation grouting, bottom outlet repair and design, and cost plus contract oversight at Mosul Dam in Iraq.</p>
<p>The purpose of this notice is to perform market research in order to determine if any A-E firms are capable and willing to perform work in the proposed area of responsibility. In accordance with standard Department of State guidance regarding Iraq, the contractor would not be provided Privileges and Immunity for its staff. Contractor may receive partial indemnification for any failure of or at Mosul Dam. A Forward Operation Base would be established at the Dam by the Government of Italy and an Italian force would provide protection at the site. Contractor could expect office space, vehicles to use, housing, ablution, food, water, Role 1 medical, and 230V/50Hz power at the site.</p>
<p>2. PROJECT INFORMATION AND WORK: The project work site is located on the Tigris River 60 km northwest of Mosul, Iraq. Mosul Dam was designed as a multi-purpose dam providing water supply, irrigation, flood control, and power generation. Main features include an embankment dam (113 m high and 2.21 km long); a service spillway (five 13.3 m wide x 13.5 m high hydraulically-operated radial gates, capable of discharging 13,000 m3/s with the reservoir elevation at 338 meters above sea level; a hydropower facility (total rated capacity of 750 MW; four power penstocks with total discharge capacity of each penstock tunnel of 280 m3/s); a bottom outlet structure (two 12-m diameter concrete conduits transitioning to two 10-m diameter tunnels with a maximum discharge capacity of 2435 m3/s); a saddle dam (1.2 km long); and an emergency spillway with fuse plug (400 m long).</p>
<p>From 1985 onward, the Mosul dam has been continuously grouted to plug seepage caused by eroding gypsum karst areas under and around the dam structure. As a result of combatant activities in northern Iraq in 2014, continuous grouting operations ceased for an extended period of time. This cessation of grouting and the natural rates of erosion have led to critical levels of erosion in the foundation. The USACE estimates that, in the last year, 5000 cubic meters of foundation material were lost due to erosion. This equates to a daily loss of approximately 15 cubic meters per day.</p>
<p>On March 2nd, 2016, the Government of Iraq (GoI) signed construction contract documents with Trevi S.p.A. (hereafter referred to as "Trevi") to pursue emergency grouting and reconstruct the bottom outlet works. The contract between the GoI and Trevi references a legal entity named "The Engineer", which for the purposes of this A-E contract is the "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers" (USACE), subject to an official agreement between the GoI and the United States Government. In order for the USACE to perform the function of "The Engineer" to the maximum extent practical, we require the professional services of an Architectural and Engineering firm (A-E) to augment our professional staff.</p>
<p>The firm, in support of TAM, shall perform geotechnical oversight, materials testing and reporting, design, and other Architectural and Engineering services to include quality assurance, technical, and administrative assistance for high volume grouting, maintenance grouting, and repair of the bottom outlet. Efforts under this task order are to a) review grouting activities, b) review grouting success and revise grout mix designs, c) advise on grouting procedures and locations, d) assess the condition of the grouting gallery and the dam's bottom outlet concrete and mechanical/electrical structures associated therewith, e) provide repair alternatives, f) monitor construction activities, and g) perform QA testing on behalf of USACE during foundation grouting and repair of the bottom outlets. The grouting and bottom outlet repair contract has been awarded to Trevi under a cost plus fee agreement. Operations would be 24/7/365 during the performance of the work.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[PRESOL - TAGGING, TRACKING AND LOCATING DATA DISSEMINATION ARCHITECTURE]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[Other Defense Agencies - <strong>As a result of the RFI posted on FBO (Solicitation Number: TTLSRSE-16-RFI-1 dated 16 February 2016) and research of all submissions provided, the Government hereby provides notice of intent to solicit and negotiate a sole source contract under FAR 6.302-1 to:</strong>
<p><strong>Corp Ten International<br />100 West RD STE 300<br />Towson, MD 21204-2370</strong></p>
<p>As a result of the submissions provided in response to the RFI, all responses fell into one of three categories as follows:</p>
<p><strong>Category 1 -</strong> Based on the information papers submitted in response to the RFI, the following companies currently have products that could meet our requirements in the near future pending DoD Network accreditation, additional device integrations, and software enhancements as required to support the USSOCOM PEO-SRSE TTL initiatives.  &lt;COMPANY NAMES REDACTED&gt;</p>
<p><strong>Category 2 - </strong>Based on the information papers submitted in response to the RFI, the following companies may have products that could meet our requirements in the future pending DoD Network accreditation, additional device integrations, and software enhancements as required to support the USSOCOM PEO-SRSE TTL initiatives, but the Government would require additional detail regarding their software platforms.  &lt;COMPANY NAMES REDACTED&gt;</p>
<p><strong>Category 3 -</strong> Based on the information papers submitted in response to the RFI, the following companies have experience with data processing, dissemination and visualization but their current tools either don't currently incorporate TTL any devices or are based on a single special-use case TTL device.  In order for these systems to meet USSOCOM PEO-SRSE current requirements, the Government will be required to invest significant funding and manpower resources.  &lt;COMPANY NAMES REDACTED&gt;</p>
<p>If the same capabilities of the system could be provided today by another company and incorporated into the architecture, thus replicating the current capability it would cost approximately $1.5M in engineering for integration into the architecture and $1.25M to re-link the devices with an approximate timeline of 2 years. Currently a simple integration takes 5 weeks and a complex integration takes 10 weeks. As of today, 6 simple and 18 complex devices are integrated into the architecture. If industry were to replicate that capability it would take approximately 210 weeks (4 years). To reduce the 4 year timeline, the Government would request that 2-3 devices be integrated concurrently to reduce the integration timeline to 2 years. Additional approximate costs that would be incurred by the Government include, $1.6M in testing and vetting process for a new approval to operate. This results in approximately $4.35M in increased costs and creates the possibility of a 3 year gap in providing this critical capability. Subsequently, a significant impact to on-going missions would result and it would cripple the ability to meet the stated Concept of Operations (CONOPS) and mission guidance of USSOCOM and conventional forces.</p>
<p>Given the varied time required to address these concerns and our immediate need to sustain current TTL operations, we will be issuing a 3 year sole source contract to Corp Ten International that provides the current software platforms for our TTL data dissemination and visualization architecture.  Over the next 3 years, PEO-SRSE will continue to follow the development of interested vendor products so that at the end of this contract interested vendors will have an opportunity to submit a qualified proposal in response the follow-on requirement.</p>
<p>The proposed action will be awarded as a 3-year Indefinite-Delivery/Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ) with a maximum ceiling value of $30,000,000.00. The basic contract will include both Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) and Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contract types for use at the task/delivery order level. The primary North American Industrial Classification Code is 518210 and the size standard is $32.5M.</p>
<p>Corp Ten International is a small business concern and shall provide USSOCOM with a software based management system for the dissemination and visualization of TTL data as well as device command and control.  This software must be capable of providing situational awareness, data collection, geospatial data, and two way communications between multiple satellite, cellular and radio frequency providers.  The Technical Requirements are listed below:</p>
<p>&bull;	Provide the ability to connect with DoD and Commercial gateways as well as other Commercial data management servers</p>
<p>&bull;	Provide a permission based system (user, admin, etc.)</p>
<p>&bull;	Provide tools for data filtering and analysis, geofencing, management of devices by groups/units, and historical querying</p>
<p>&bull;	Allow for the integration of 3rd party devices as directed by the Government</p>
<p>&bull;	Remotely configure and send messages to devices, query devices for configuration information</p>
<p>&bull;	Operate in a DoD cloud based network and meet DISA Security Technical Implementation Guides (STIG) mandatory requirements</p>
<p>&bull;	Provide options for hosting and maintaining physical server based systems at the Contractor facility</p>
<p>&bull;	Provide technical and training support 24/7/365</p>
<p>&bull;	Provide over-the-horizon airtime services (Globalstar, Iridium, Cellular, etc.)</p>
<p>&bull;	Provide U.S personnel cleared to the Secret level as well as Secret cleared facility at the start of the task</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All responses and any questions under this Pre-Solicitation Notice of Intent to Sole Source must be emailed to SRSE-RFI@SOCOM.MIL</p>]]></description>

For those task orders, CX firms are required to employ staff with a SECRET clearance or capable of obtaining a SECRET clearance, qualified to perform the anticipated project work as well as access to a Defense Security System (DSS) certified computer system. Additionally, some tasks may require a Top Secret/Sensitive Compartmented Information (TS/SCI) clearance.</p>
<p>3. SELECTION CRITERIA. The selection criteria are listed below in descending order or importance. Criteria a-e are primary. Criteria f-h are secondary criteria and will only be used as tie-breakers among firms that are essentially technically equal.</p>
<p>a. Specialized Experience and Technical Competence:</p>
<p>The following sub-criteria are listed in descending order of importance. Only information included in Section F of the SF 330 will be the basis for evaluation of this subfactor.</p>
<p>(1)Experience as the Commissioning Authority on construction projects similar to N2W.</p>
<p>For a project to be considered similar, the experience must include:</p>
<p>i.Commissioning of all systems to include the building enclosure - (i.e. Total Building Commissioning).<br /><br />ii.Involvement as the Commissioning Authority (CxA) from project beginning to end. (Acting as an owner's representative or project manager providing oversight of commissioning activities primarily performed by other entities will not be considered equivalent to actually performing commissioning)</p>
<p>Additional consideration for project similarity will include:</p>
<p>iii.Facility size (500,000 SF excluding parking structures)</p>
<p>iv.Facility type - (A facility with mission critical IT systems and redundant power, cooling and utilities)</p>
<p>v.Secure Compartmental Information Facility (SCIF) Facilities or similar level of security constraint (narrative must describe how it is similar) for <br />significant portion (at least 25%) of the facility).</p>
<p>vi.Sustainably certified projects (or projects in the process of obtaining certification) in accordance with: LEED Gold, Net-Zero, ASHRAE 189.1 high-performing building, or other industry-recognized sustainability rating system.</p>
<p>(2) Professional affiliation with nationally recognized commissioning organizations. (i.e. Building Commissioning Association (BCxA) Certified Commissioning Firm (CCF) or full membership in the AABC Commissioning Group (ACG). Only information included in Section H of the SF 330 will be the basis for evaluation of this sub factor).</p>
<p>(3) Experience establishing "Continuous Commissioning" Programs for facilities with complex mechanical and electrical systems similar to the level required for the NGA facility. Only information included in Section F of the SF 330 will be the basis for evaluation of this subfactor.</p>
<p>(4) Experience working on projects requiring secret or TS/SCI clearance. Only information included in Section F of the SF 330 will be the basis for evaluation of this sub factor.</p>
<p>b. Professional Qualifications<br />Firms shall demonstrate the professional qualifications in the following key disciplines: Commissioning Project Manager, lead Mechanical Engineer Commissioning Agent, lead Electrical Engineer Commissioning Agent, and lead Engineer or Architect Enclosure Commissioning Agent. The key disciplines are weighted equally. The education, professional registration, relevant certifications, relevant experience, longevity with the firm, and relevant project experience on similar projects will be considered. Project experience does not need to be the same as those projects submitted for the firm. A bachelor's degree, professional registration and certification from a nationally recognized commissioning organization (i.e. BCxA Certified Commissioning Professional, (CCP), or ACG Commissioning Authority, CxA) are minimum requirements. <br />This criterion is primarily concerned with the qualifications of the key personnel and not the number of personnel. The number of personnel is addressed under the capacity criterion below. The basis of evaluation will be information provided in section E of the SF 330.</p>
<p>c. Past Performance <br />Past performance on DoD and other contracts with respect to quality of work and compliance with performance schedules will be evaluated. The Contractor Performance Assessment Reports System (CPARS) is the primary source of information on past performance. CPARS will be queried for all firms submitting a SF330. If deemed appropriate by the evaluation board, performance evaluations for any significant team subcontractors may also be considered. The board will consider the relevancy of each performance evaluation on CX services contracts to the proposed contract, including the type of work, performing office, age of the evaluation, and whether subsequent evaluations indicate a change in a firm's performance. In addition to CPARS, the board may seek information on past performance from other sources. Each project in Section F of the SF 330 shall include contact information for the owner, designer, and the construction contractor. A firm that has earned excellent evaluations and/or positive feedback on recent DoD and other contracts for similar size, scope, and complexity of projects will be given additional consideration.</p>
<p>d. Capacity to initiate work and complete within the time parameters of the project. <br />The evaluation will consider the availability of an adequate number of personnel for mechanical, electrical and enclosure (architects 0r mechanical engineers) commissioning work. The evaluation will look at numbers listed in Part II of the SF330 to evaluate the overall capacity of the team. Include a Part II form for each firm that is part of the proposed team. In section H, include a chart that indicates the number of personnel with CX expertise and whose primary activity is commissioning for mechanical, electrical and enclosure systems.</p>
<p>e. Knowledge of the locality <br />Knowledge of local conditions within Missouri and Illinois, specifically regarding climatic conditions and local construction methods including geotechnical considerations. (key disciplines: Mechanical Engineer and Enclosure Engineer or Architect). Appropriate experience must be shown in each discipline to be counted. Experience in the greater St. Louis area will have greater importance. Evaluation will look at the specific experience of the proposed team (including all team members in each key discipline, not just the leads) as stated in Section E of the SF 330. <br />Secondary Selection Criteria. The following secondary criteria will only be used as a tie-breaker among firms that are essentially technically equal. The secondary criteria will not be co-mingled with the primary criteria in the evaluation. The three secondary selection criteria are listed in descending order of importance.</p>
<p>f. Geographic Proximity. <br />Responding firms should identify any offices operated in close proximity to the St. Louis metropolitan area and the contribution these office(s) will make in support of the project. The basis of the evaluation will be information submitted in Section H of the SF 330.</p>
<p>g. Small Business Participation. <br />Extent of participation of small businesses (SB), small disadvantaged businesses (SDB), women-owned small businesses (WOSB), HUBZone small businesses, Veteran Owned small businesses, Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Businesses, historically black colleges and universities (HBCU), and minority institutions (MI) will be measured as a percentage of the total anticipated contract effort. The greater the participation, the greater the consideration. Large businesses will be expected to place subcontracts to the maximum practical extent with Small and Small Disadvantaged firms in accordance with Public Law 95-507. The basis of the evaluation will be information submitted in Section H of the SF 330.</p>
<p>h. Volume of DoD AE Contract Awards for CX in the last 12 months. Responding firms should cite all contract numbers, task orders and modifications, award dates and total negotiated fees for any DoD AE contract awarded for CX within the past twelve (12) months. This information will assist in effecting an equitable distribution of DoD AE contracts for CX among qualified firms.<br /><br />4. SUBMITTAL REQUIREMENTS.

            <title><![CDATA[SRCSGT - GEOINT]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[Other Defense Agencies - Requirement:
<p>SOCOM needs the capability to locally manage &amp; disseminate its foundation, map, and imagery (geospatial) data throughout the SOCOM AOR. SOCOM needs to provide current/relevant/updated/near real-time geospatial data (vector, raster, and elevation) to SOCOM geospatial customers within a two hour timeframe (upon notification) on multiple deployable external data drives (SD card, thumb drive, external hard drive) and domains (SIPR, NIPR). Data to be disseminated needs to be selectable via a Graphical User Interface using a "rubber-band" style selection tool and a Map of the region of the world involved. Once selected, the size of the potential data to be transferred to the external drive will be displayed so that a decision can be made to transfer the data or redraw the area to be transferred, or if there are multiple layers, determine which layers are not necessary, prior to transfer being initiated. The solution needs to be capable of managing and disseminating large volumes of geospatial data &lt;&lt;definition of large volume?&gt;&gt; over the network to include bandwidth-disadvantaged users operating on SOF Deployable Network - Medium/Light (SDN-M/L). Access to the data needs to be obtained using map/imagery data software and /or web browser.</p>
<p>Solution needs to be Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) interoperable with map &amp; imagery displaying software and provide Keyhole Markup Language (KML) services. The solution must allow for seamless integration and usage with GOTS/COTS exploitation and visualization software and tools. These must include FalconView, RemoteView, SOCET GXP, ArcGIS, ENVI, Google Earth, Palantir, ERDAS and the Global Command and Control System (GCCS). Additionally, the solution must allow for user defined outputs to all DoD standard geospatial formats, to include, NITF, GEOTIFF, MRSID, PNG, JPEG2000, JPG, ERDAS.IMG, and others.<br />The solution must provide the ability to generate custom deployable drives containing data and web services (KML and OGC) for disconnected users. SOF users and analysts often operate in austere locations with limited or non-existent connectivity. Upon CIF deployment analysts must have the ability to conduct planning and analysis en-route to operational location without communication infrastructure. Having a self-contained, deployable drive that can provide OGC and KML services to disconnected, mobile, and multiple users is paramount. Data managers must be able to create a drive which is usable by COTS/GOTS tools that are KML and OGC compliant.</p>
<p>The solution must have the ability to provide real-time updating of existing data layers without disrupting live services. It must allow the on-site data manager to seamlessly upload, patch, and update foundation base layers without disconnecting access to web services or requiring the data source to be modified and/or replaced. The solution must allow on-site analysts to maintain the data and serve as the data manager with limited excessive effort. The solution should provide a reduced data management option that simplifies maintenance/updates and still maintains optimum performance.</p>
<p>Justification:</p>
<p>Currently, SOCOM doesn't have this capability resident at the Enterprise level. Each TSOC and component are researching and attempting to fund solutions independently, with at least one organization that currently funds this capability themselves to meet their mission requirements. The current Enterprise mapping arch is insufficient to meet the current and future needs of the enterprise. During the GEOINT WG in April 2014 at SOCOM, all of the TSOCs and Components present echoed their desire to gain a similar capability.</p>
<p>As of today, the SOCOM organizations do not have a capability that meets their enterprise and disconnected requirement to provide GEOINT data and visualization services to tactical SOF operations.</p>
<p>Who requires service/system?<br />TSOCs, SOCOM Components, a SOCOM Enterprise need</p>
<p>Estimated Number of People Affected?<br />Significant</p>
<p>Which network will the service or system be applied? <br />SIPR/NIPR</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Department of Health and Human Services - Food and Drug Administration<br />Request for Information <br />For ORA's Regulatory Business Information Services (RBIS) Requirements<br />Anticipated Contract Type: Single Award BPA
<p><br />Summary<br />This Request for Information (RFI) is issued in support of the anticipated acquisition of the Food and Drug Administration's procurement of services and technical resources to maintain and continue to enhance the Regulatory Business Information Services (RBIS) system.   It is anticipated that this requirement will result in the award of a single award Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA)  and, based on the responses to this RFI, the FDA will be able to determine the appropriateness of small business participation.</p>
<p>Background<br />This RFI is for information, planning and market research purposes only and shall not be construed as either a solicitation or obligation on the part of the Food and Drug Administration or its Centers.  The purpose of this RFI is to help the FDA understand the industry best practices and technical solutions capable of providing the full range of services described in this RFI and draft SOW.  FDA will use this market research information to assess the market's capability to successfully meet FDA's Dashboard toolset requirements.  FDA welcomes responses from all interested parties. FDA does not intend to make a selection decision or award a contract on the basis of responses nor otherwise pay for the preparation of any information submitted or FDA's use of such information. Responses to this RFI are not quotes on which the FDA can issue any Schedule orders. This RFI is issued for information and planning purposes only and does not itself constitute a Request for Quotations (RFQ). The Government does not intend to award a Schedule order(s) or BPAs based only on responses to this RFI. Acknowledgment of receipt of responses will not be made, nor will respondents be notified of the outcome of the FDA's review of the information received.  Additionally, the FDA does not intend to hold discussions concerning this RFI with any interested parties.  However, FDA reserves the right to contact vendors if additional information is required.</p>
<p>The FDA is requesting comments on the draft SOW from both large and small businesses. Comments from all sized firms are welcome.  In addition, the purpose of this RFI is twofold:  first, to determine the acquisition strategy regarding small business participation, and second, to obtain industry comments on the draft Statement of Work (SOW).  Through this process, the FDA is requesting the capabilities and past performance of small business contractors interested in providing these services across the FDA.  Interested small business contractors including Small Disadvantaged Business, Women-Owned, 8(a)'s, HUBZones, Veteran-Owned, or Service Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses are encouraged to respond.</p>
<p>General Instructions<br />A complete response to the RFI should include answers to all of the questions below.    Responses should demonstrate capability, not merely affirm the respondent's capability (e.g.: The response must go beyond the statement that, "XYZ company can provide a tool.").</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to submit comments and suggestions related to the draft Statement of Work. Please submit the response in Microsoft Word or PDF format. Information should not exceed fifteen (15) one sided 8 &frac12; x 11 pages, with one inch margins, and font no smaller than 12 point.</p>
<p>Responses should be emailed to Michele Andrews, Contract Specialist at Michele.Andrews@fda.hhs.gov no later than 12:00 PM (noon) Eastern Time, January 13, 2016.</p>

Projects within the Pacific and Indian Ocean areas will be evaluated more favorably than projects conducted in other geographic regions. Specialized experience of the prime firm will be evaluated more favorably than that of the subconsultants. 

Ensure that each project cited is either a standalone contract for a single tasking or a single task/delivery order on an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity contract.  If more than five projects are provided, only the first five will be considered. Projects that have not been completed will be excluded from evaluation consideration.
 
2.	Professional Qualifications of Key Personnel.

 The chart shall be submitted on a single 11” x 17” sized sheet and use a font size of 10 points or larger.  Resumes of personnel providing supporting services (items a through s above) are not required and will not be evaluated.
3.   Past Performance.  A-E firms will be evaluated based on past performance on projects relevant to selection criterion (1) above with Government agencies and private industry in terms of cost control, quality of work, and compliance with performance schedules.  Past performance information not related to the projects related selection criterion (1) will not be considered.  The A-E shall provide ACASS performance documentation or similar for each project.  If an ACASS performance documentation or similar for each project is not available, provide a Performance Survey (download from the NECO website) and submit the Survey with the SF330).
  The Performance Survey shall be from the contracting agent and/or their representative responsible for the contract administration, or from the facility owner/user.  It shall not be from the prime contractor on a project nor shall it be from a prime contractor to a subcontractor.  If the A-E received any less than satisfactory past performance evaluations from customers/owners, it is incumbent upon the A-E to provide an explanation of the rating and what the A-E has done or will do to preclude less than satisfactory ratings on future contracts.  In evaluating past performance, the Government may consider information in the A-E’s SF330 and information gathered from other sources including former customers, Government agencies, federal databases and other references.
  The info provided by the A-E may provide the major portion of the information used in the Governments evaluation for past performance.  The Government, however, is not restricted to the information provided by the Offeror and may use other sources to assess  past performance info such as the Past Performance Info Retrieval System (PPIRS), A-E Contract Administration Support System (ACASS), and inquiries with previous customers/owners. 

SUBMISSION REQUIREMENT: (SF330, Part 1, Section H).  If an A-E is utilizing past performance information of affiliates/subsidiaries/parent /LLC/LTD member companies, the proposal shall clearly demonstrate that the affiliate/subsidiary/parent/LLC/LTD member companies will have meaningful involvement in the performance of the contract in order for the past performance info of the affiliate/subsidiary/parent/LLC/LTD member companies to be considered.
  

The information submitted shall state specific commitments of technical resources (e.g. personnel, equipment) that the affiliate/subsidiary/parent/LLC/LTD member companies will commit to the performance of this contract.  In particular, the submitted information will clearly state the specific commitments of resources of the affiliate/subsidiary/parent/LLC/LTD member that will perform the contract requirements.  The SF330 shall also describe specific roles of the affiliate/subsidiary/parent/LLC/LTD member companies in terms of the work it will either self-perform or manage on behalf of the A-E for future task orders in performance of the contract.  A subcontractors or subconsultants past performance will not be given the same level of consideration as either the prime contractor or the joint venture partner because there is no direct legal relationship between the Government and the subcontractor/subconsultant.

The Government will consider the past performance and experience of a subcontractor/subconsultant where the prime contractor provides, in its SF330, evidence of a binding teaming agreement or other contractual agreement which creates legal responsibility on the part of the prime contractor and the subcontractor/subconsultant to enter into a subcontract.
 However, the level of consideration will depend on the extent to which the A-E demonstrates the prime contractors commitment to award a subcontract to the subcontractor/subconsultant and subcontractors/subconsultants commitment to enter into a subcontract with the prime contractor, including legal accountability for both parties.  Prime contractor-subcontractor/subconsultant teams/Joint Ventures/LLCs/LTDs with a demonstrated history of working successfully together on prior projects may be considered more favorably than those without such history.

4.	Capacity to accomplish the work in the required time. 

SUBMISSION REQUIREMENT:  (SF330, Part 1, Section H).  Describe the proposed team’s ability to complete several large and small task orders concurrently requiring quick turnaround.
  Describe the firm’s ability to perform and manage multiple complex projects in different locations and the ability to surge to meet unexpected demands.
Describe the firm’s ability to provide qualified backup staffing for key personnel to ensure continuity of service with minimal disruption to projects initiated under other NAVFAC PAC contracts/task orders. Indicate the firm’s current workload and the availability of the prime and subconsultants for the specified performance period.

5.	Quality Control Program. 

SUBMISSION REQUIREMENT:  (SF330, Part 1, Section H).  Briefly describe how the prime ensures quality consistently across the entire team and how quality of subcontractors work is assured.
  Briefly describe internal quality assurance procedures and indicate effectiveness. Address the team’s QC processes for checking documents for errors, omissions and quality and incorporating and tracking review comments.

6.	A-E Firm’s Location: A-E firms will be evaluated on the locations of the office or offices from which the A-E firm will perform the work under this contract.  Locations within the general geographical area of the work and knowledge of the locality of the work (e.g., Hawaii, Guam, and other areas within the NAVFAC Pacific AOR) will be evaluated. 

SUBMISSION REQUIREMENT:  (SF330, Part 1, Section H).  Indicate the location of the office that will be performing the work including sub-consultants offices.
  Describe and illustrate the team’s knowledge of the geographical area (e.g., Hawaii, Guam, and other areas within the NAVFAC Pacific AOR).  Address ability of the firm to ensure timely response to requests for on site support.   

7.	Volume of Work: A-E firms will be evaluated in terms of work previously awarded to the A-E firm by Department of Defense (DoD) within the past 12 months, with the objective of effecting an equitable distribution of Department of Defense A-E contracts among qualified A-E firms and firms that have not had Department of Defense contracts.

SUBMISSION REQUIREMENT: (SF330, Part 1, Section H).  Provide a list of DoD contracts or task orders awarded in the past 12 months.
  Include dollar amount for each contract/task order awarded.  If the firm performed work as a subcontractor, indicate the contract and/or task order of the prime contractor and the estimated amount completed as the subcontractor.  A-E firms with multiple offices shall indicate which branch office completed each project.

            <title><![CDATA[PRESOL - NATO International Competitive Bidding (ICB): Upgrade Geographic Information Services Increment 3]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[Department of Commerce - The NATO Communications and Information Agency (NCI Agency) intends to issue an Invitation for Bid (IFB) in relation to the implementation of the project "Upgrade Geographic Information Services Increment 3 - CP9C0150".
<p>The scope of this upcoming opportunity is anticipated to be an upgrade of the Core GIS system addressing deficiencies and new requirements; upgrading the software baseline provided under Increment 2; ensuring common functional capability across all Core GIS sites; making Core GIS compatible with DCIS and furthermore, meeting the requirements of the Bi-SC Service Employment in Support of the NATO Command Structure.</p>
<p>Potential U.S. prime contractors must 1) hold a facility security clearance at the level of SECRET or higher, 2) be pre-approved for participation in NATO International Competitive Bidding (ICB) and 3) be nominated to the bidders list by the U.S. Government.</p>
<p>The reference for the IFB is IFB-CO-14179-GIS and all correspondence concerning the IFB should reference this number.</p>
<p>It is planned to award a single firm-fixed price contract for the entire scope of work with an expected duration of 16 months and follow on contract options for Spiral 2, for additional sites in Kosovo and Afghanistan as well as for 2 additional years of warranty. No partial bidding will be allowed.</p>
<p>SUMMARY OF REQUIREMENTS</p>
<p>Please see attached. These requirements are being refined and detailed as part of the<br />preparation of the IFB.</p>
<p>BECOMING ELIGIBLE TO BID</p>
<p>NATO ICB requires that the U.S. Government nominate U.S. prime contractors to the bidders list. Before the U.S. Government can nominate a U.S. prime contractor to the bidders list, however, the firm must be approved for participation in NATO ICB. Firms are approved for NATO ICB on a facility-by-facility basis.</p>
<p>The NATO ICB application is a one-time application. The application requires supporting documentation in the form of 1) a company resume indicating contracts completed as a prime contractor and 2) an annual report or set of financial documents indicating compilation, review, or audit by an independent CPA.</p>
<p>U.S. firms can download a copy of the U.S. NATO ICB application from the following website:</p>
<p>http://www.bis.doc.gov/index.php/other-areas/strategic-industries-and-economic-security-sies/nato-related-business-opportunities</p>
<p>The application and supporting documentation may be submitted as e-mail attachments. If, when submitting the application, your firm is interested in a specific NATO ICB project, please include the following in the text of your email:</p>
<p>- the title and/or solicitation number of the project<br />- the name/phone/FAX/email of the point of contact for the bid documents</p>
<p>After approval of your one-time NATO ICB application, the U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC) will then know to follow up by issuing a Declaration of Eligibility (DOE) for that project. NATO member governments use a DOE to nominate an approved firm to the bidders list for a particular NATO ICB project.</p>
<p>IMPORTANT DATES:</p>
<p>- Request from DOC that a DOE be issued (and, for firms new to NATO ICB, submit the completed one-time NATO ICB application): 25 February 2016<br /><br />- IFB issued (target): April 2016</p>
<p>- Bid Closing (target) : July 2016</p>
<p>- Contract Award (target): November 2016</p>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[PRESOL - Maintenance of ArcGIS licenses used for NATO Core GIS]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[Department of Commerce - The NATO Communications and Information Agency (NCI Agency) intends to issue an Invitation for Bid (IFB) for the provision of standard software maintenance of ArcGIS licenses used for NATO Core GIS (Geographic Information Systems).
<p>NCI Agency is responsible for the in-service support of major NATO Communications and Information Systems, some of which are under the management and monitoring of the Joint Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance (JISR) Service Line (SL), which is located at The Hague (Netherlands). The JISR SL is responsible for the management, monitoring, and maintenance of the NATO core GIS.</p>
<p>Potential U.S. prime contractors must 1) be pre-approved for participation in NATO International Competitive Bidding (ICB) and 2) be nominated to the bidders list by the U.S. Government.</p>
<p>The reference for the IFB is IFB-NCIA-JISR-15-07 and all correspondence concerning the IFB should reference this number.</p>
<p>It is planned to place a single contract for the entire scope of work. No partial bidding will be allowed.</p>
<p>SUMMARY OF REQUIREMENTS</p>
<p>Please see attached.</p>
<p>BECOMING ELIGIBLE TO BID</p>
<p>NATO ICB requires that the U.S. Government nominate U.S. prime contractors to the bidders list. Before the U.S. Government can nominate a U.S. prime contractor to the bidders list, however, the firm must&nbsp;be approved for participation in NATO ICB. Firms are approved for NATO ICB on a facility-by-facility basis.</p>
<p>The NATO ICB application is a one-time application. The application requires supporting documentation in the form of 1) a company resume indicating contracts completed as a prime contractor and 2) an annual report or set of financial documents indicating compilation, review, or audit by an independent CPA.</p>
<p>U.S. firms can download a copy of the U.S. NATO ICB application from the following website:</p>
<p>http://www.bis.doc.gov/index.php/other-areas/strategic-industries-and-economic-security-sies/nato-related-business-opportunities</p>
<p>The application and supporting documentation may be submitted as e-mail attachments. If, when submitting the application, your firm is interested in a specific NATO ICB project, please include the following in the text of your email:</p>
<p>- the title and/or solicitation number of the project<br />- the name/phone/FAX/email of the point of contact for the bid documents</p>
<p>After approval of your one-time NATO ICB application, the U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC) will then know to follow up by issuing a Declaration of Eligibility (DOE) for that project. NATO member governments use a DOE to nominate an approved firm to the bidders list for a particular NATO ICB project.</p>
<p>IMPORTANT DATES:</p>
<p>- Request from DOC that a DOE be issued (and, for firms new to NATO ICB, submit the completed one-time NATO ICB application): 03 December 2015<br /><br />- IFB issued (target): 11 December 2015</p>
<p>- Bid closing (target) : 29 January 2016</p>
<p>- Contract Award (target): mid-February 2016</p>]]></description>

<p>There are two Focus Areas:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1) Analytics for Situation Awareness<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2) Data Framework and Core Services</p>
<p>Proposers may address all or parts of any of the two focus areas and must clearly indicate the technical area(s) being addressed in the white paper (see content and format section below). Teaming is highly encouraged. All performers under this BAA will be expected to work cooperatively with one another to develop, integrate, implement, test, and evaluate technical capabilities. Therefore, proposers should carefully review the expectations for all focus areas in order to fully understand the context of their own focus area.</p>
<p><strong>Focus Area Descriptions:</strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Focus Area 1- Analytics for Situation Awareness</span></strong></p>
<p>Situation Awareness is defined as the perception of the elements in the environment within a volume of time and space, the comprehension of their meaning, and the projection of their status in the near future. This BAA is immediately focused on researching and developing novel analytic techniques to accomplish situation awareness in the battlespace for perception, comprehension and projection. In order to achieve this goal, these analytics must be mission-focused and have a strong impetus towards creating a decision advantage.</p>
<p><strong>1.1 Analytic Services:</strong> Analytic techniques can be wide ranging. This BAA is concentrated on a broad spectrum of analysis procedures to include, but is not limited to pattern analysis, spatial-temporal analysis, change detection, link analysis, social network analysis, and big data analytics. These analytic techniques must be developed as services made available in a plug and play, modular design.</p>
<p><strong>1.2 Machine Learning:</strong> This BAA shall also provide cutting-edge machine learning capabilities to assist and automate user tasks. Potential applications include providing recommendations based on what data the user is interested in and has viewed, assisting with task management and the delegation of tasks, deriving alerts from patterns of life and indications and warnings, and learning and automating common user actions such as routine queries.</p>
<p><strong>Focus Area 2 - Data Framework and Core Services</strong></p>
<p>The data framework and core services are intended to provide the fundamental and essential components to develop an enterprise software system. This will serve as an overarching integration framework that will be responsible for interfacing with analytic services while providing required capabilities such as data access, security, and visualization services.</p>
<p><strong>2.1 Infrastructure:</strong> Software infrastructure developed under this BAA shall provide a lightweight, open source Enterprise Service Bus (ESB) framework that is capable of facilitating the interaction and communication between services and other software applications in a service-oriented architecture. The ESB shall provide capabilities to integrate databases, services, and legacy systems and facilitate communication across disparate transport and messaging technologies. The infrastructure shall support a myriad of database systems to include, but not limited to document-oriented databases and NoSQL data stores. Lastly, the infrastructure shall be designed to serve as a platform as a service, as well as be interoperable with other third party services.</p>
<p><strong>2.2 Data Framework Services:</strong> Proposers shall provide a data framework that is able to discover, model, connect, search and enter data across a variety of types and sources. For external data sources, this data framework shall extract, transform and load diverse data sources while performing data alignment and association to reduce and resolve duplicative entities that exist in multiple data sources. The system shall be able to search to find data across data types and sources. This search can be based on specific user-defined keywords, semantic search, and also faceted search. This search function shall leverage natural language processing techniques to ensure high precision and recall. The proposed system shall allow search results to be manipulated in a pivot table-like fashion which could update any graphic based on that data.</p>
<p><strong>2.3 Security Services</strong>: The proposed system shall include a robust and flexible security framework. At a minimum, this shall contain: (1) policy-based access control and role-based access control (RBAC) that allows users access while also restricting system access only to authorized users. RBAC will control the roles assigned, allow authorized users to take on specific roles (e.g. administrator), and exercise permission. (2) The system shall also utilize single sign-on (SSO) authentication and public key infrastructure (PKI) for authenticating users that access the system. (3) Lastly, the system shall provide audit logs and the ability for system administrators to provide key system level metrics. Secure application development practices shall be followed to minimize rework required to comply with DoD Information Assurance (IA) policies. Software provided shall successfully pass various security vulnerability scans such as Fortify, Nessus, and Burp in order to achieve authority to operate on operational networks. Also, the security services shall appropriately mark data per classification standards (e.g. Controlled Access Program Coordination Office (CAPCO) markings).</p>
<p><strong>2.4 User Experience Services:</strong> This system shall provide end users with a fully customizable enterprise experience. For instance, customizable dashboards shall be available once users sign-in to the system. Dashboards can also be developed for use by a specific community. The dashboard will serve as the main interface for the system and must be fully customizable to allow operators to search and select the data they need to see once the system is accessed and provide user-specified information (specific to the user's AOR) on their requested display (e.g. map, graph). The user interface shall also allow users to share data, files, and notes and provide a collaborative social workspace. This workspace will permit users to save and share queries and working files, create target folders on entities of interest, and provide a user workflow for publishing reports and documents. The workflow will allow users to create, review, update and delete reports and rely on role-based access control for permissions. The user will also be able to export reports and records as appropriate. Lastly, the user experience and interface shall be reusable and domain agnostic.</p>
<p><strong>2.5 Visualization Services</strong>: Users shall be able to access and visualize data through a myriad of methods. This BAA shall research how users interact with the user interface and develop novel visualization displays. Proposed approaches shall allow users to query the centralized database and output results to a diverse set of visualization displays. As data is selected, the visualization displays shall provide the full details on the data by displaying the data record. Typical displays include, but are not limited to table, report view, grid, graph, map (2D/3D, heatmap), timeline, and link analysis.</p>
<p><strong>2.6 Report Generator Services:</strong> Many times, users are required to develop a briefing or report to share and publish. The proposed approach shall provide a capability to automate this process, saving critical time that can be better spent analyzing data. This report generation capability shall allow users the ability to output their required data to different report types to include, but not limited to Microsoft PowerPoint, Excel, Word, and Adobe PDF.</p>
<p><strong>2.7 Mobile, Disconnected, and Disadvantaged Operations:</strong> The data framework and infrastructure designed and developed shall allow users to operate the software system from a mobile device. For users with little or no connectivity, the proposed approach shall allow users to still perform in an appropriate manner. Disconnected Operations shall allow users to have access to key capabilities of the system such as search and data entry with no connectivity. For disadvantaged users with little bandwidth, the system shall be able to execute in a lightweight manner so that users can still conduct critical functions.</p>

IMPORTANT: If you do not have a DCAA approved accounting system access the following link for instructions: <a href="https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&amp;mode=form&amp;id=1cffad228f48b58057072a6c9113799d&amp;tab=core&amp;_cview=1">https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&amp;mode=form&amp;id=1cffad228f48b58057072a6c9113799d&amp;tab=<br />core&amp;_cview=1</a></p>
<p><strong>V. APPLICATION REVIEW INFORMATION:</strong></p>
<p>1. CRITERIA: The following criteria, which are listed in equal importance and will be used to determine whether white papers and proposals submitted are consistent with the intent of this BAA and of interest to the Government:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. Overall Scientific and Technical Merit - The soundness of approach for the development and/or enhancement of the proposed technology, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. Related Experience - The extent to which the offeror demonstrates relevant technology and domain knowledge, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c. Openness, Maturity and Assurance of Solution - The extent to which existing capabilities and standards are leveraged and the relative maturity of the proposed technology in terms of reliability and robustness, and <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d. Reasonableness and realism of proposed costs and fees (if any).</p>
<p>No further evaluation criteria will be used in selecting white papers/proposals. White papers and proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received.</p>
<p>2. REVIEW AND SELECTION PROCESS:</p>
<p>Only Government employees will evaluate the white papers/proposals for selection. The Air Force Research Laboratory's Information Directorate has contracted for various business and staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain administrative access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors. Administrative access is defined as "handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in the administrative support contract, which do not require the review, reading, and comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks." These contractors have signed general non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements. The required administrative access will be granted to non-technical professionals. Examples of the administrative tasks performed include: a. Assembling and organizing information for R&amp;D case files; b. Accessing library files for use by government personnel; and c. Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries. Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection.</p>
<p>3. ADEQUATE PRICE COMPETITION: The Government may simultaneously evaluate proposals received under this BAA with a common cutoff date for multiple offerors. In this case, the Government may make award based on adequate price competition, and offerors must be aware that there is a possibility of non-selection due to a proposal of similar but higher-priced technical approach as compared to another offeror.</p>
<p><br /><strong>VI. STEP TWO INFORMATION - REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL &amp; AWARD:</strong></p>
<p>1. AWARD NOTICES: Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Notification by email or letter will be sent by the technical POC. Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract. Those white papers not selected to submit a proposal will be notified in the same manner. Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.</p>

ONRR is transforming its framework for geospatial information and migrating from exclusively reacting to discrete product requirement-submissions to using methodologies that deliver content through user interaction with a web-based service.  ONRR is pursuing applications, services, and technological ideas to expand its Geographic Information Systems GIS services to the ONRR community.  ONRR seeks to make geospatial data, tools, technology, and services more accessible, discoverable, sharable, reusable, and reliable to the ONRR community which includes State, local, and tribal governments.&nbsp;<br /><br />ONRR currently performs analyses and delivers GIS products on an as-needed basis. A team of GIS analysts reviews requests, performs analyses, and creates products in response to the request. ONRR does not have a user interface that allows individual users to view the data, perform analysis, or create cartographic products or reports. ONRR uses the Department of Interior (DOI) standard GIS software provided by ESRI. Internal GIS developers use ESRI products to create, update, and maintain data and products with data stored primarily in the file geodatabase format. Several file geodatabases are comprised of a variety of data assembled from several sources internal and external in ESRI formats or derived from ESRI formats.</span></p>
<p>The contractor shall be capable of furnishing all required labor, material, facilities and equipment to develop an enterprise-level GIS with the characteristics listed below.<br /> <br />1.	Multiple users:  ONRR has approximately 600 users.  Of those users about 10 percent will be accessing the system simultaneously. Users have role-level definitions.  We require the ability to scale to external users.<br />2.	Multiple physical locations:  Users will access the system from several geographic locations with users in both ONRR facilities and non-ONRR facilities. Access to the system is through direct desktop connections, virtual private networks, and Citrix.<br />3.	Web-based:  This will be a web-based system.<br />4.	User role-based access:  ONRR users can access the GIS based on roles to create, view, and analyze data, and produce products such as maps, charts, and graphs.<br />5.	Centralized data:  The data are centralized in a relational database management system such as Oracle or SQL Server.<br />6.	Multiple data sources:  The system will incorporate data acquired from several organizations including Bureau of Land Management (BLM), Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM), Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), United States Geological Survey (USGS), and private industry.<br />7.	Data integration:  Data integrated into the system are stored in multiple formats including ESRI, Oracle, SQL Server, MS Access, and MS Excel.<br />8.	Internal developers:  ONRR GIS developers can manage data and objects, perform analyses, produce products, and build web applications, queries and scripts. <br />9.

            <title><![CDATA[PRESOL - Vessel Monitoring System and Services]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[Department of Commerce - The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Eastern Acquisition Division (EAD), Norfolk, VA, on behalf of the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), Office of Law Enforcement (OLE), is soliciting a contract for Vessel Monitoring System (VMS) and Services. The contract type will be a combination of firm-fixed-price and time-and-materials. The nature of the work to be performed includes, but is not limited to, providing the following: VMS satellite surveillance software and systems integration, VMS communication services, VMS-related materials and services, and VMS satellite surveillance software support and maintenance.
<p>The Vessel Monitoring System (VMS) is a satellite surveillance system which is primarily used to monitor the location and movement of commercial fishing vessels in the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) and international regional fisheries management organization (RFMO) areas. VMS supports law enforcement initiatives, for regulatory and statutory violation prevention, and for other fishery data-collection purposes. Data from VMS is used as evidence in the prosecution of many environmental laws and regulations including regional fishing quotas, the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (MSFCMA), the Endangered Species Act (ESA), and the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA).</p>
<p>The system employs satellite-based communications from Enhanced Mobile Transceiver Units (EMTU), which are on-board transceiver devices that certain vessels are required to carry. The VMS program monitors over 4,000 vessels 24 hours a day, 365 days of the year. The NMFS OLE employs software to receive, store, and provide to users (via embedded graphical map display, graphical text display or via export to common external data and GIS software formats) the location of those commercial fishing vessels that are required by laws and/or regulations to install and operate an EMTU on board their vessel.

            <title><![CDATA[SRCSGT - Training Instructor Operator Support Services (TRIOSS)]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[Department of the Army - <br />1. DESCRIPTION <br /><br />On behalf of the U.S Army Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training and Instrumentation (PEO STRI), the Army Contracting Command (ACC) is issuing its second Sources Sought Notice (SSN) for the Training, Instructor, Operator Support Services (TRIOSS) acquisition as a means to identify small business capabilities in managing a diverse portfolio of Instructor and Operator (I/O) support service requirements.
<p>THIS SOURCES SOUGHT IS INTENDED FOR SMALL BUSINESS ONLY. As large businesses are not permitted to respond, small businesses in all socioeconomic categories (including 8(a) Business Development Program, Historically Underutilized Business Zone, Service Disabled Veteran-Owned, Women-Owned Small Business, etc.) are highly encouraged to respond with capabilities and recommendations in meeting this requirement to support a small business set-aside. If your company previously responded to the initial SSN, the Government requests your company provide an additional response, addressing the specific concerns outlined in Paragraph 5 of this notice.</p>
<p>2. BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The requirements within TRIOSS are currently being satisfied by PEO STRI through existing IDIQ contract vehicles, inclusive of the Warfighter FOCUS (WFF) contract and Medical Modeling and Simulation Training (MMAST) contract.</p>
<p>The U.S Army Contracting Command, Orlando (ACC-ORL) is currently considering the utilization of a Single Award Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (SA-IDIQ) contract to satisfy this broad range of service requirements.</p>
<p>The Government has selected North American Industrial Code System (NAICS) code 541990 - All Other Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services, with an associated size standard of $15M/Annually as part of its strategy.</p>
<p>The anticipated ceiling value for the TRIOSS acquisition is estimated to be $292M.</p>
<p>3. PURPOSE</p>
<p>Based on analysis from the initial TRIOSS SSN posted on 22 June 2015, PEO STRI is considering setting this requirement aside for small businesses to follow-on existing Training Aids, Devices, Simulators and Simulations (TADSS) related I/O support services, if market research supports doing so.</p>
<p>The primary catalyst of this second SSN is the pattern of industry concern, recognized in evaluating the initial SSN responses, regarding the apparent broad scope of the TRIOSS requirement. In an effort to further refine its acquisition strategy as well as mitigate potential risks, ACC-O is providing industry with supplementary information to facilitate in answering the questions outlined in paragraph 5 of this notice.</p>
<p>The intent of this sources sought is to identify small businesses capable of seamlessly managing the entire scope of the TRIOSS acquisition (outlined in para. 4 below), as well as propose viable approaches to challenges that may be encountered in implementing a multi-faceted I/O services acquisition.</p>
<p>NOTE: This potential contract would require rapid execution (e.g. 3-6 week turnaround for proposal preparation, negotiations and award of task orders and change orders as they arise). Associated task orders would require the contractor(s) to provide a highly competent and culturally sensitive workforce capable of satisfying a breadth of unique services located at both CONUS and OCONUS locations, under multiple task orders, SECRET and TOP SECRET clearances, with overlapping performance periods. A sound management approach will be required to efficiently manage the complexity and vast scope of this requirement.</p>
<p>4. GENERAL SCOPE</p>
<p>The following list of programs represent historical PEO STRI TADSS-related I/O support services currently being considered for the TRIOSS acquisition. NOTE: The programs outlined below are the same requirements as those identified in the initial SSN; however, percentages of the total scope have been applied to each sub-program as well as historical Full-Time Employee (FTE) counts (sub-paragraphs ii. and iii. below). While future requirements cannot be predicted, please use the general scope provided below in answering the questions stipulated in paragraph 5 of this notice.</p>
<p>&nbsp; a. MEDICAL SIMULATION TRAINING CENTERS (MSTC)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; i. DESCRIPTION: MSTC is a standardized family of medical training components that facilitate immersive and rigorous training in Tactical Combat Casualty Care (TCCC). The MSTC training components include a computerized bleed-breathe mannequin that is weighted and airway equipped, partial task trainers and associated equipment. Enabling technology includes audiovisual enhancements, camera surveillance capability, computer labs, and control rooms with a remotely managed training platform.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ii. PERCENTAGE (%) of TOTAL SCOPE: 38.60%</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; iii. HISTORICAL FTE COUNT: 109</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; iv. SUMMARY OF REQUIREMENTS: The contractor shall provide instruction and administrative management necessary to deliver scheduled medical training.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; v.

            <description><![CDATA[Department of Transportation - In accordance with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Acquisition Management System (AMS) paragraph 3.2.2.4, the purpose of this announcement is to inform industry of the basis for the FAA's decision to contract with AVL – North America, via single source procedures.

This procurement is in support of the FAA’s IT Business Office. The award will be for the procurement of ArcGIS software licenses and support.  
The Esri technology provides the FAA the ability to fulfill the FAA’s airspace mission in ways that were not previously possible and its enablement and standardization are also an important component of overarching DOT-wide goals. The Esri ELA grants the FAA the capacity to harmoniously combine numerous similarly oriented initiatives which can be leveraged by many FAA programs as well as outside government organizations to meet mission requirements. This Geographic Information System (GIS) or geospatial technology is not offered by other software that is compatible with FAA Systems.
Esri, Inc. developed this software and the Government has no rights in design or development of this source code. In 2008, an Enterprise License Agreement was established between the FAA and Esri. Esri does have authorized resellers and business partners. 
Accordingly, a competitive solicitation is not available for this procurement. The FAA is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals. The FAA is not liable for any costs associated with the preparing of a response to this announcement.  Any questions or comments about this announcement must be directed to Stephanie Taylor at stephanie.a.taylor@faa.gov, no later than 12 p.m. (local time) on September 25, 2015.

            <title><![CDATA[SRCSGT - A--Research and Development Source Sought, FY16 Living Marine Resources (LMR) Program Environmental Need Topics]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[Department of the Navy - This announcement constitutes a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) for the Naval Facilities Engineering and Expeditionary Warfare Center (NEXWC) under FAR 6.102(d)(2) and 35.106. A formal Request for Proposals (RFP), other solicitation, or additional information regarding this announcement will not be issued.

FAR Part 35 restricts the use of BAAs, such as this, to the acquisition of basic and applied research and that portion of advanced technology development not related to the development of a specific system or hardware procurement. Contracts made under BAAs are for scientific study and experimentation directed towards advancing the state of the art and increasing knowledge or understanding.
  This announcement is not for the acquisition of technical, engineering, or other types of support services.

The Naval Facilities Engineering and Expeditionary Warfare Center, through the Living Marine Resources (LMR) program, is soliciting pre-proposals for efforts related to any one of the two (2) need topics listed below. If invited, offerors will be asked to submit a full proposal.

NEED TOPICS:

NEED TOPIC 1: BEHAVIORAL RESPONSE RESEARCH TO STUDY THE EFFECTS OF SOUND ON MARINE MAMMALS. (LMR N-0102-16). There are two high priority behavioral response research topics in the order of interest to the Living Marine Resources program:

1.	Behavioral response research to improve our understanding of the potential effects from Navy training and testing activities.
 Studies of priority interest include questions such as: (a) range dependent effects on behavioral responses; (b) in priority order, behavioral response to Navy active sonar sources transmitting in the frequency ranges of: i) 1-10 kHz; ii) 10-100 kHz; iii) 100-1000 Hz; (c) link between behavior state and response.  For all proposed studies, baseline data on animal behavior should be obtained or previously collected for comparison with behavioral response data. 
2.	Demonstration of medium and long-term tags, which utilize Fastloc GPS satellite technology and collect high-fidelity dive profile and possibly measure sound exposure data, to study animal movement and behavioral response. There is a need to demonstrate developed tag technologies that can record animal movement and behavioral responses over a longer-term duration from weeks to months.
 

See Appendix A for LMR priority species and geographic regions. Proposals should include appropriate research approaches including but not limited to:  controlled exposure experiment on captive and free-ranging animals, observational studies in relation to exposure to real Navy sources, etc. In addition, proposals should include appropriate methods including but not limited to tagging, direct measurement, passive acoustics, etc.  

NEED TOPIC 2: MARINE SPECIES HEARING RESEARCH RELATED TO THE ACOUSTIC EFFECTS CRITERIA. (LMR N-0103-16). There are three high priority hearing research topics of interest to the Living Marine Resources program:

1.	Audiograms of hearing capability in marine species that have limited data available or have not been previously studied.
 Species priority includes:  marine mammals (beaked whales, small delphinids, mysticetes), diving sea birds (e.g. Auk family), and sea turtles. 
2.	Hearing research to study temporary threshold shift (TTS) at multiple frequencies for marine species, to include marine mammals, sea turtles, and possibly diving sea birds, with sufficient audiometric data.
3.	Effects to fish from the detonation of explosive devices of various charge sizes, depths, and distances to the subjects. Must include data on well characterized received and estimated source levels.

Priority interest is in species where we have no or insufficient data available. Results from these studies will be used to refine the Navy acoustic effects criteria for determining impact.
  

SUPPORTING INFORMATION:
For more information on what is required in a proposal, guidance on LMR priority species and geographic regions, how to submit a proposal via the LMR website, and how proposals are evaluated, refer to Appendix A. Offerors will be required to adhere to the data rights and handling procedures agreement (Appendix B) and the geospatial data requirements (Appendix C). Modifications to the data rights and handling procedures agreement or geospatial data requirements should be discussed with the LMR program staff prior to proposal submission. Offerors will also need to comply with the U.S. Navy Handling Procedures for Ocean Observing Systems (OOS) Data (Appendix D) and the Ocean Observing Systems Awareness and Compatibility Memorandum (Appendix E).
  Offerors should note, however, that locations labelled in red in Appendix E as incompatible with acoustic OOS actually overlap with some of the LMR priority geographic regions outlined in Appendix A. Strict adherence to passive acoustic monitoring site selection, passive acoustic device deployment notification and data custody guidance will be required. Site selection should be discussed with the LMR program staff prior to submission of the proposal package. DoD is still finalizing their plan to meet the goals and requirements of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) memorandum titled Increasing Access to the Results of Federally Funded Scientific Research issued 2013 February 22.
 All projects funded by LMR would be subject to DoD policy once it is finalized.

WEB-BASED SUBMISSION PROCESS: 
Submissions should be made via the LMR program website, www.lmr.navy.mil, identifying one, and only one, of the three listed need topic areas as the primary focus of the pre-proposal. Pre-proposals and full proposals will only be evaluated under one need topic.

SUBMISSION DEADLINE: 
To be considered for funding in FY 2016, pre-proposals must be received no later than 5:00 pm, Pacific Standard Time on 23 OCTOBER, 2015. If invited to submit a full proposal, these will be due 30 days after notification.  

EVALUATION PROCESS: 
Offerors will receive an automated email message acknowledging successful submission to the LMR program website.
 Following a 2 month evaluation and approval process, successful pre-proposal offerors will receive an email inviting submission of a full proposal, also via the LMR program website. Unsuccessful pre-proposal offerors will receive an email via the LMR program website, but will not receive a detailed description of the reasons for pre-proposal rejection, due to the anticipated volume of submissions. Awards to non-government entities (academic institutions, not-for-profit organizations, industry) will be in the form of contracts. A nominal award amount has not been provided because the scope of the need topics varies considerably. However, proposals less than $300K/year are more likely to be funded given the limited budget of the LMR program in FY 2016.
  The nominal duration of a project is expected to be 1-3 years, with a maximum of 5 years. Applicants are strongly encouraged to use realism of cost for the proposed effort as their metric, as this will be a critical element in the review process.  Otherwise meritorious pre-proposals and full proposals will be rejected if cost does not accurately reflect the proposed scope of work.

Proposed efforts involving interaction with and contact with marine mammals or endangered species may require research permits including but not limited to a Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) Research Permit, Endangered Species Act (ESA) scientific research permit, and/or Department of Defense Animal Care and Use authorization.
 If the offeror currently possesses a permit or other documentation, it should be mentioned in the pre-proposal and submitted as part of the full proposal. If your project involves developing or demonstrating a technology, an agreement with NAVFAC EXWC will need to be established to describe the ownership/use of the technology. Contracts will not be awarded without appropriate regulatory documentation and all agreements in place.

EVALUATION CRITERIA: 
The pre-proposals and full proposals will be evaluated based on the following criteria, of approximately equal weight.

1.	TECHNICAL APPROACH: The scientific/technical merits and objectives in terms of meeting the stated need topic, as well as evidence that the science/technology is mature enough for applied research funding, and the performance criteria to measure success of the research effort.
 

2.	OFFEROR’S EXPERIENCE: For the pre-proposal phase, the offeror should clearly provide evidence or examples showing experience related to the solution being proposed. The organization’s capabilities related to experience, techniques, or a unique combination of these that are integral factors in achieving the contractors proposed objectives. This equates to past performance, and will be assessed based on both relevance and confidence. If invited to submit a full proposal, NAVFAC also requires the offeror to provide their EMR and DART ratings. Safety is an integral and important aspect in all NAVFAC work. If the offeror does not have an EMR/DART rating, they should state this and provide a narrative rationale.
 See NFAS 15.304. 

3.	PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR’S AND KEY MEMBER’S RELATED EXPERIENCE: For the pre-proposal phase, the offeror should provide the name, highest degree earned, organization/affiliation, location, and years of experience for the Principal Investigator and key personnel who are critical in achieving the objectives of the proposal. Principle Investigators and key personnel should be identified in the pre-proposal as such. If invited to submit a full proposal, the offeror will need to upload CVs for the Principal Investigator and key personnel.

4.	COST/PRICE: The cost relative to the proposed scientific/technical approach. For the pre-proposal phase this information may be limited to a total cost estimate by calendar year (Jan 1 – December 31).
 Assume for Year 1 of your project that effort will begin in August due to the time it takes to get a contract in place. It is assumed in Year 1 (August-December) of the project your cost estimate should only include effort associated with basic initiation of the project and that the majority of effort would take place in Year 2 and beyond. In addition to any other relevant travel required for the project, please include a trip for the PI to attend the In-Progress Review (IPR) meeting each year (fall) in Port Hueneme, CA to present on the progress of the project. If invited to submit a full proposal, additional guidance on cost/price information will be provided. This is not prescriptive, and can be submitted in the contractor’s format.
 However, the same information will be required.

5.	NAVY BENEFITS AND IMPACT: Expected benefits of the proposed project, key issues the proposed solution addresses, potential application of the results of the project, and advantages over current approaches.

6.	PRODUCT IMPLEMENTATION: Describe the intended product(s) and all associated deliverables, the requirements for implementing the proposed products of this effort by the Navy, and the potential technical risks that may pose a challenge to successful implementation.

NOTES:
1.	An eligible pre-proposal or full proposal does not guarantee a contract. Multiple contracts may result.

2.	An offeror is required to register with the system for award management (SAM).
 No contract award will be made to any offeror that is not registered. Registration may take up to three weeks. SAM may be accessed at https://www.sam.gov. Registration is not required for proposal submission, but must be completed prior to initiation of award negotiation.  To avoid delays in the award process, applicants are encouraged to initiate SAM registration early in the submission and review process.  Non-government awardees will also need to provide a DUNS (Dunn  and  Bradstreet) number (http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform/displayHomePage.doc) and CAGE (Commercial and Government Entity) code (http://govwin.com/knowledge/ccr-registration) before an award can be made. 

3.	The preceding data should be sufficient for completing the pre-proposal form.

4.	There are no solicitation documents applying to this LMR program BAA.
 Request for a solicitation package will not be acknowledged. Those interested in participating in the LMR program BAA must follow the instructions to submit a pre-proposal.

5.	There is no commitment by the Navy either to make any contract awards or to be responsible for any money expended by the contractor before a contract award.

6.	As no funding for contracts has been reserved in advance, NEXWC will be sharing qualified pre-proposals with other Federal Government activities to seek demonstration sites and/or funding. Some Federal Government activities may employ civilian contractors to determine the applicability of an offered technology to specific projects. Technical and cost pre-proposals and full proposals submitted under this BAA will be protected from unauthorized disclosure in accordance with FAR 3.104-4 and 15.207.
 The cognizant Program Manager and other scientific experts will perform the evaluation of technical proposals. Restrictive notices notwithstanding, one or more support contractors may be utilized as subject-matter-expert technical consultants in accordance with FAR 37.204. However, pre-proposal and full proposal selection and award decisions are solely the responsibility of Government personnel.   Each support contractor’s employee having access to technical and cost pre-proposals and full proposals submitted in response to this BAA will be required to sign a non-disclosure statement prior to receipt of any pre-proposal or full proposal submissions. An offeror may require the non-government personnel to execute a supplemental non- disclosure agreement by including a copy of their institutional NDA with their proposal.
 However, note that a failure to come to an agreement may impact the ability to make an award. Please review FAR 37.204 and NFAS 15.303(d)(4). Eligibility notification will be sent to all contractors who have submitted a pre-proposal, after the Technical Review Committee (TRC) and Living Marine Resources Advisory Committee (LMRAC) have reviewed all pre-proposals submitted by the solicitation cut-off date.

7.	For questions regarding this BAA, contact NAVFAC EXWC at (805) 982-4853 or (805) 982-5872 or via this e-mail address: exwc_lmr_program@navy.mil. Correspondents are advised not to include Personally Identifiable Information (PII), business proprietary, or competition-sensitive information via email.
  Offerors will receive an automated email message acknowledging successful submission to the LMR program website. If the contractor does not receive a notification of pre-proposal receipt, the contractor should call or e-mail NEXWC by using the phone number or e-mail address provided in this section.

8.	Historically Black Colleges/Universities and Minority Institutions (HBCU/MI) will be recognized according to DFARS 226.3. All responsible sources from academia and industry may submit proposals. No portion of this BAA will be set aside for HBCU and MI participation, due to the impracticality of reserving discrete or severable items of this research for exclusive competition among the entities.
  Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs) including Department of Energy National Laboratories, are not eligible to receive awards under this   BAA. However, teaming arrangements between FFRDCs and eligible principal bidders are allowed so long as they are permitted under the sponsoring agreement between the Government and the specific FFRDC. 

DFARS 235.017-1 allows DOD FFRDCs which function primarily as research laboratories to apply. Naval laboratories and Warfare Centers as well as other DOD and civilian agency laboratories are not eligible to receive awards under this BAA and should not directly submit proposals in response to this BAA. If any such organization is interested in one or more of these program areas, they should contact the NEXWC program office to discuss its interest.
 As with the FFRDCs, these organizations may team with other responsible sources from   industry and academia that are submitting proposals under the BAA. University Affiliated Research Centers (UARC) are eligible to submit proposals under this BAA unless precluded from doing so by their DOD UARC contract or an organizational conflict of interest.

9.	Do not call the Contracting Office for verification. The pre-proposal is not received by the Contracting Office.]]></description>
