 Studies of priority interest include questions such as: (a) range dependent effects on behavioral responses; (b) in priority order, behavioral response to Navy active sonar sources transmitting in the frequency ranges of: i) 1-10 kHz; ii) 10-100 kHz; iii) 100-1000 Hz; (c) link between behavior state and response.  For all proposed studies, baseline data on animal behavior should be obtained or previously collected for comparison with behavioral response data. 
2.	Demonstration of medium and long-term tags, which utilize Fastloc GPS satellite technology and collect high-fidelity dive profile and possibly measure sound exposure data, to study animal movement and behavioral response. There is a need to demonstrate developed tag technologies that can record animal movement and behavioral responses over a longer-term duration from weeks to months.
 

See Appendix A for LMR priority species and geographic regions. Proposals should include appropriate research approaches including but not limited to:  controlled exposure experiment on captive and free-ranging animals, observational studies in relation to exposure to real Navy sources, etc. In addition, proposals should include appropriate methods including but not limited to tagging, direct measurement, passive acoustics, etc.  

NEED TOPIC 2: MARINE SPECIES HEARING RESEARCH RELATED TO THE ACOUSTIC EFFECTS CRITERIA. (LMR N-0103-16). There are three high priority hearing research topics of interest to the Living Marine Resources program:

1.	Audiograms of hearing capability in marine species that have limited data available or have not been previously studied.
 Species priority includes:  marine mammals (beaked whales, small delphinids, mysticetes), diving sea birds (e.g. Auk family), and sea turtles. 
2.	Hearing research to study temporary threshold shift (TTS) at multiple frequencies for marine species, to include marine mammals, sea turtles, and possibly diving sea birds, with sufficient audiometric data.
3.	Effects to fish from the detonation of explosive devices of various charge sizes, depths, and distances to the subjects. Must include data on well characterized received and estimated source levels.

Priority interest is in species where we have no or insufficient data available. Results from these studies will be used to refine the Navy acoustic effects criteria for determining impact.
  

SUPPORTING INFORMATION:
For more information on what is required in a proposal, guidance on LMR priority species and geographic regions, how to submit a proposal via the LMR website, and how proposals are evaluated, refer to Appendix A. Offerors will be required to adhere to the data rights and handling procedures agreement (Appendix B) and the geospatial data requirements (Appendix C). Modifications to the data rights and handling procedures agreement or geospatial data requirements should be discussed with the LMR program staff prior to proposal submission. Offerors will also need to comply with the U.S. Navy Handling Procedures for Ocean Observing Systems (OOS) Data (Appendix D) and the Ocean Observing Systems Awareness and Compatibility Memorandum (Appendix E).
  Offerors should note, however, that locations labelled in red in Appendix E as incompatible with acoustic OOS actually overlap with some of the LMR priority geographic regions outlined in Appendix A. Strict adherence to passive acoustic monitoring site selection, passive acoustic device deployment notification and data custody guidance will be required. Site selection should be discussed with the LMR program staff prior to submission of the proposal package. DoD is still finalizing their plan to meet the goals and requirements of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) memorandum titled Increasing Access to the Results of Federally Funded Scientific Research issued 2013 February 22.
 All projects funded by LMR would be subject to DoD policy once it is finalized.

WEB-BASED SUBMISSION PROCESS: 
Submissions should be made via the LMR program website, www.lmr.navy.mil, identifying one, and only one, of the three listed need topic areas as the primary focus of the pre-proposal. Pre-proposals and full proposals will only be evaluated under one need topic.

SUBMISSION DEADLINE: 
To be considered for funding in FY 2016, pre-proposals must be received no later than 5:00 pm, Pacific Standard Time on 23 OCTOBER, 2015. If invited to submit a full proposal, these will be due 30 days after notification.  

EVALUATION PROCESS: 
Offerors will receive an automated email message acknowledging successful submission to the LMR program website.
 Following a 2 month evaluation and approval process, successful pre-proposal offerors will receive an email inviting submission of a full proposal, also via the LMR program website. Unsuccessful pre-proposal offerors will receive an email via the LMR program website, but will not receive a detailed description of the reasons for pre-proposal rejection, due to the anticipated volume of submissions. Awards to non-government entities (academic institutions, not-for-profit organizations, industry) will be in the form of contracts. A nominal award amount has not been provided because the scope of the need topics varies considerably. However, proposals less than $300K/year are more likely to be funded given the limited budget of the LMR program in FY 2016.
  The nominal duration of a project is expected to be 1-3 years, with a maximum of 5 years. Applicants are strongly encouraged to use realism of cost for the proposed effort as their metric, as this will be a critical element in the review process.  Otherwise meritorious pre-proposals and full proposals will be rejected if cost does not accurately reflect the proposed scope of work.

Proposed efforts involving interaction with and contact with marine mammals or endangered species may require research permits including but not limited to a Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) Research Permit, Endangered Species Act (ESA) scientific research permit, and/or Department of Defense Animal Care and Use authorization.
 If the offeror currently possesses a permit or other documentation, it should be mentioned in the pre-proposal and submitted as part of the full proposal. If your project involves developing or demonstrating a technology, an agreement with NAVFAC EXWC will need to be established to describe the ownership/use of the technology. Contracts will not be awarded without appropriate regulatory documentation and all agreements in place.

EVALUATION CRITERIA: 
The pre-proposals and full proposals will be evaluated based on the following criteria, of approximately equal weight.

1.	TECHNICAL APPROACH: The scientific/technical merits and objectives in terms of meeting the stated need topic, as well as evidence that the science/technology is mature enough for applied research funding, and the performance criteria to measure success of the research effort.
 

2.	OFFEROR’S EXPERIENCE: For the pre-proposal phase, the offeror should clearly provide evidence or examples showing experience related to the solution being proposed. The organization’s capabilities related to experience, techniques, or a unique combination of these that are integral factors in achieving the contractors proposed objectives. This equates to past performance, and will be assessed based on both relevance and confidence. If invited to submit a full proposal, NAVFAC also requires the offeror to provide their EMR and DART ratings. Safety is an integral and important aspect in all NAVFAC work. If the offeror does not have an EMR/DART rating, they should state this and provide a narrative rationale.
 See NFAS 15.304. 

3.	PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR’S AND KEY MEMBER’S RELATED EXPERIENCE: For the pre-proposal phase, the offeror should provide the name, highest degree earned, organization/affiliation, location, and years of experience for the Principal Investigator and key personnel who are critical in achieving the objectives of the proposal. Principle Investigators and key personnel should be identified in the pre-proposal as such. If invited to submit a full proposal, the offeror will need to upload CVs for the Principal Investigator and key personnel.

4.	COST/PRICE: The cost relative to the proposed scientific/technical approach. For the pre-proposal phase this information may be limited to a total cost estimate by calendar year (Jan 1 – December 31).
 Assume for Year 1 of your project that effort will begin in August due to the time it takes to get a contract in place. It is assumed in Year 1 (August-December) of the project your cost estimate should only include effort associated with basic initiation of the project and that the majority of effort would take place in Year 2 and beyond. In addition to any other relevant travel required for the project, please include a trip for the PI to attend the In-Progress Review (IPR) meeting each year (fall) in Port Hueneme, CA to present on the progress of the project. If invited to submit a full proposal, additional guidance on cost/price information will be provided. This is not prescriptive, and can be submitted in the contractor’s format.
 However, the same information will be required.

5.	NAVY BENEFITS AND IMPACT: Expected benefits of the proposed project, key issues the proposed solution addresses, potential application of the results of the project, and advantages over current approaches.

6.	PRODUCT IMPLEMENTATION: Describe the intended product(s) and all associated deliverables, the requirements for implementing the proposed products of this effort by the Navy, and the potential technical risks that may pose a challenge to successful implementation.

NOTES:
1.	An eligible pre-proposal or full proposal does not guarantee a contract. Multiple contracts may result.

2.	An offeror is required to register with the system for award management (SAM).
 No contract award will be made to any offeror that is not registered. Registration may take up to three weeks. SAM may be accessed at https://www.sam.gov. Registration is not required for proposal submission, but must be completed prior to initiation of award negotiation.  To avoid delays in the award process, applicants are encouraged to initiate SAM registration early in the submission and review process.  Non-government awardees will also need to provide a DUNS (Dunn  and  Bradstreet) number (http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform/displayHomePage.doc) and CAGE (Commercial and Government Entity) code (http://govwin.com/knowledge/ccr-registration) before an award can be made. 

3.	The preceding data should be sufficient for completing the pre-proposal form.

4.	There are no solicitation documents applying to this LMR program BAA.
 Request for a solicitation package will not be acknowledged. Those interested in participating in the LMR program BAA must follow the instructions to submit a pre-proposal.

5.	There is no commitment by the Navy either to make any contract awards or to be responsible for any money expended by the contractor before a contract award.

6.	As no funding for contracts has been reserved in advance, NEXWC will be sharing qualified pre-proposals with other Federal Government activities to seek demonstration sites and/or funding. Some Federal Government activities may employ civilian contractors to determine the applicability of an offered technology to specific projects. Technical and cost pre-proposals and full proposals submitted under this BAA will be protected from unauthorized disclosure in accordance with FAR 3.104-4 and 15.207.
 The cognizant Program Manager and other scientific experts will perform the evaluation of technical proposals. Restrictive notices notwithstanding, one or more support contractors may be utilized as subject-matter-expert technical consultants in accordance with FAR 37.204. However, pre-proposal and full proposal selection and award decisions are solely the responsibility of Government personnel.   Each support contractor’s employee having access to technical and cost pre-proposals and full proposals submitted in response to this BAA will be required to sign a non-disclosure statement prior to receipt of any pre-proposal or full proposal submissions. An offeror may require the non-government personnel to execute a supplemental non- disclosure agreement by including a copy of their institutional NDA with their proposal.
 However, note that a failure to come to an agreement may impact the ability to make an award. Please review FAR 37.204 and NFAS 15.303(d)(4). Eligibility notification will be sent to all contractors who have submitted a pre-proposal, after the Technical Review Committee (TRC) and Living Marine Resources Advisory Committee (LMRAC) have reviewed all pre-proposals submitted by the solicitation cut-off date.

7.	For questions regarding this BAA, contact NAVFAC EXWC at (805) 982-4853 or (805) 982-5872 or via this e-mail address: exwc_lmr_program@navy.mil. Correspondents are advised not to include Personally Identifiable Information (PII), business proprietary, or competition-sensitive information via email.
  Offerors will receive an automated email message acknowledging successful submission to the LMR program website. If the contractor does not receive a notification of pre-proposal receipt, the contractor should call or e-mail NEXWC by using the phone number or e-mail address provided in this section.

8.	Historically Black Colleges/Universities and Minority Institutions (HBCU/MI) will be recognized according to DFARS 226.3. All responsible sources from academia and industry may submit proposals. No portion of this BAA will be set aside for HBCU and MI participation, due to the impracticality of reserving discrete or severable items of this research for exclusive competition among the entities.
  Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs) including Department of Energy National Laboratories, are not eligible to receive awards under this   BAA. However, teaming arrangements between FFRDCs and eligible principal bidders are allowed so long as they are permitted under the sponsoring agreement between the Government and the specific FFRDC. 

DFARS 235.017-1 allows DOD FFRDCs which function primarily as research laboratories to apply. Naval laboratories and Warfare Centers as well as other DOD and civilian agency laboratories are not eligible to receive awards under this BAA and should not directly submit proposals in response to this BAA. If any such organization is interested in one or more of these program areas, they should contact the NEXWC program office to discuss its interest.
 As with the FFRDCs, these organizations may team with other responsible sources from   industry and academia that are submitting proposals under the BAA. University Affiliated Research Centers (UARC) are eligible to submit proposals under this BAA unless precluded from doing so by their DOD UARC contract or an organizational conflict of interest.

9.	Do not call the Contracting Office for verification. The pre-proposal is not received by the Contracting Office.]]></description>

Consistent with the purposes of the Dodd-Frank Act, the CFPB's mission is to establish and enforce clear, consistent rules for the financial marketplace, protect American families from unfair financial practices, and develop and implement a strategy to improve the financial literacy of consumers.

            <title><![CDATA[SRCSGT - Training Instructor Operator Support Services (TRIOSS)]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[Department of the Army - <br />1. DESCRIPTION <br /><br />On behalf of the U.S Army Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training and Instrumentation (PEO STRI), the Army Contracting Command (ACC) is issuing its second Sources Sought Notice (SSN) for the Training, Instructor, Operator Support Services (TRIOSS) acquisition as a means to identify small business capabilities in managing a diverse portfolio of Instructor and Operator (I/O) support service requirements.
<p>THIS SOURCES SOUGHT IS INTENDED FOR SMALL BUSINESS ONLY. As large businesses are not permitted to respond, small businesses in all socioeconomic categories (including 8(a) Business Development Program, Historically Underutilized Business Zone, Service Disabled Veteran-Owned, Women-Owned Small Business, etc.) are highly encouraged to respond with capabilities and recommendations in meeting this requirement to support a small business set-aside. If your company previously responded to the initial SSN, the Government requests your company provide an additional response, addressing the specific concerns outlined in Paragraph 5 of this notice.</p>
<p>2. BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The requirements within TRIOSS are currently being satisfied by PEO STRI through existing IDIQ contract vehicles, inclusive of the Warfighter FOCUS (WFF) contract and Medical Modeling and Simulation Training (MMAST) contract.</p>
<p>The U.S Army Contracting Command, Orlando (ACC-ORL) is currently considering the utilization of a Single Award Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (SA-IDIQ) contract to satisfy this broad range of service requirements.</p>
<p>The Government has selected North American Industrial Code System (NAICS) code 541990 - All Other Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services, with an associated size standard of $15M/Annually as part of its strategy.</p>
<p>The anticipated ceiling value for the TRIOSS acquisition is estimated to be $292M.</p>
<p>3. PURPOSE</p>
<p>Based on analysis from the initial TRIOSS SSN posted on 22 June 2015, PEO STRI is considering setting this requirement aside for small businesses to follow-on existing Training Aids, Devices, Simulators and Simulations (TADSS) related I/O support services, if market research supports doing so.</p>
<p>The primary catalyst of this second SSN is the pattern of industry concern, recognized in evaluating the initial SSN responses, regarding the apparent broad scope of the TRIOSS requirement. In an effort to further refine its acquisition strategy as well as mitigate potential risks, ACC-O is providing industry with supplementary information to facilitate in answering the questions outlined in paragraph 5 of this notice.</p>
<p>The intent of this sources sought is to identify small businesses capable of seamlessly managing the entire scope of the TRIOSS acquisition (outlined in para. 4 below), as well as propose viable approaches to challenges that may be encountered in implementing a multi-faceted I/O services acquisition.</p>
<p>NOTE: This potential contract would require rapid execution (e.g. 3-6 week turnaround for proposal preparation, negotiations and award of task orders and change orders as they arise). Associated task orders would require the contractor(s) to provide a highly competent and culturally sensitive workforce capable of satisfying a breadth of unique services located at both CONUS and OCONUS locations, under multiple task orders, SECRET and TOP SECRET clearances, with overlapping performance periods. A sound management approach will be required to efficiently manage the complexity and vast scope of this requirement.</p>
<p>4. GENERAL SCOPE</p>
<p>The following list of programs represent historical PEO STRI TADSS-related I/O support services currently being considered for the TRIOSS acquisition. NOTE: The programs outlined below are the same requirements as those identified in the initial SSN; however, percentages of the total scope have been applied to each sub-program as well as historical Full-Time Employee (FTE) counts (sub-paragraphs ii. and iii. below).

The TCC supports Combat Training Centers and Homestation intelligence sustainment training by merging the Live, Virtual and Constructive training environments. IEWTPT provides a realistic target environment for multi-intelligence disciplines including Signal Intelligence (SIGINT), Imagery Intelligence (IMINT), Human Intelligence (HUMINT), Counterintelligence (CI), Measurement and Signal Intelligence (MASINT), Geospatial Intelligence (GEOINT), and Open Source Intelligence (OSINT). IEWTPT must stimulate multiple systems' Target Signature Arrays (TSAs) (Tactical Unmanned Aircraft Systems (TUAS), Tactical Exploitation System (TES), Common Ground System (CGS), Guardrail Common Sensor (GRCS), Counterintelligence and Human Intelligence Automated Reporting and Collection System (CHARCS), Distributed Common Ground System-Army (DCGS-A), Aerial Common Sensor (ACS), Prophet, etc.) as well as SIGINT Quick Reaction Capabilities (QRC's). In addition, IEWTPT provides a set of exercise support tools (i.e. SIGACT Generator, SIGINT ExCON, iLOD, etc.) specific to Intelligence training.</p>

SUMMARY OF REQUIREMENTS: The contractor shall set-up, configure,&nbsp;monitor, operate, and provide all functions encompassing planning, operation, and After Action Reviews, as dependent on existing site capabilities in support of Technical Control Cell (TCC)/ HUMINT Control Cell (HCC) operations. The contractor shall coordinate TCC and HCC support directly with units and provide instruction consistent with unit leadership guidance and training requirements. The contractor shall develop Training Support Plans to meet specific unit training objectives. Based on time and TCC operational requirements, HCC support may involve a train-the-trainer type support allowing multiple HCC operations to take place in conjunction with TCC support. The contractor shall set-up, configure, monitor, operate, and provide all functions in support of HCC operations as a stand-alone system or in conjunction with other systems. The contractor shall enter into Associate Contractor Agreement(s) with the Army TADSS Maintenance Program (ATMP) contractor as necessary to provide access to IEWTPT components and coordinate maintenance support.</p>

The contractor, by exception may request to bring on an Individual with a Secret Clearance. In such cases, a TS (SCI) request shall be submitted immediately. As determined by the government and within a reasonable period of time a TS (SCI) clearance or interim TS is not awarded to the individual, then this will be deemed grounds for dismissal from the program. The contractor shall submit a request for Special Compartmented Access with the specific tags associated with each specific site's Special Compartmented Information Facility (SCIF). Dismissal of an employee does not relieve the Contractor from timely work performance of the contract requirements. The IEWTPT teams are required to support training based on a 40-hour workweek for a total of 50 weeks a year. The contractor should maximize the use of a flex schedule within each 40-hour workweek in order to minimize the requirement for Overtime. If the use of a flex schedule cannot support the requirements then the contractor should provide a Field Budget Estimate or Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) to the customer in order to determine if resources are available to support the extended requirement. Contractor personnel shall be required to travel to various locations including OCONUS to support training conducted in remote modes or travel to Orlando for system update training.

<p>There are two Focus Areas:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1) Analytics for Situation Awareness<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2) Data Framework and Core Services</p>
<p>Proposers may address all or parts of any of the two focus areas and must clearly indicate the technical area(s) being addressed in the white paper (see content and format section below). Teaming is highly encouraged. All performers under this BAA will be expected to work cooperatively with one another to develop, integrate, implement, test, and evaluate technical capabilities. Therefore, proposers should carefully review the expectations for all focus areas in order to fully understand the context of their own focus area.</p>
<p><strong>Focus Area Descriptions:</strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Focus Area 1- Analytics for Situation Awareness</span></strong></p>
<p>Situation Awareness is defined as the perception of the elements in the environment within a volume of time and space, the comprehension of their meaning, and the projection of their status in the near future. This BAA is immediately focused on researching and developing novel analytic techniques to accomplish situation awareness in the battlespace for perception, comprehension and projection. In order to achieve this goal, these analytics must be mission-focused and have a strong impetus towards creating a decision advantage.</p>
<p><strong>1.1 Analytic Services:</strong> Analytic techniques can be wide ranging. This BAA is concentrated on a broad spectrum of analysis procedures to include, but is not limited to pattern analysis, spatial-temporal analysis, change detection, link analysis, social network analysis, and big data analytics. These analytic techniques must be developed as services made available in a plug and play, modular design.</p>
<p><strong>1.2 Machine Learning:</strong> This BAA shall also provide cutting-edge machine learning capabilities to assist and automate user tasks. Potential applications include providing recommendations based on what data the user is interested in and has viewed, assisting with task management and the delegation of tasks, deriving alerts from patterns of life and indications and warnings, and learning and automating common user actions such as routine queries.</p>
<p><strong>Focus Area 2 - Data Framework and Core Services</strong></p>
<p>The data framework and core services are intended to provide the fundamental and essential components to develop an enterprise software system. This will serve as an overarching integration framework that will be responsible for interfacing with analytic services while providing required capabilities such as data access, security, and visualization services.</p>
<p><strong>2.1 Infrastructure:</strong> Software infrastructure developed under this BAA shall provide a lightweight, open source Enterprise Service Bus (ESB) framework that is capable of facilitating the interaction and communication between services and other software applications in a service-oriented architecture. The ESB shall provide capabilities to integrate databases, services, and legacy systems and facilitate communication across disparate transport and messaging technologies. The infrastructure shall support a myriad of database systems to include, but not limited to document-oriented databases and NoSQL data stores. Lastly, the infrastructure shall be designed to serve as a platform as a service, as well as be interoperable with other third party services.</p>
<p><strong>2.2 Data Framework Services:</strong> Proposers shall provide a data framework that is able to discover, model, connect, search and enter data across a variety of types and sources. For external data sources, this data framework shall extract, transform and load diverse data sources while performing data alignment and association to reduce and resolve duplicative entities that exist in multiple data sources. The system shall be able to search to find data across data types and sources. This search can be based on specific user-defined keywords, semantic search, and also faceted search. This search function shall leverage natural language processing techniques to ensure high precision and recall. The proposed system shall allow search results to be manipulated in a pivot table-like fashion which could update any graphic based on that data.</p>
<p><strong>2.3 Security Services</strong>: The proposed system shall include a robust and flexible security framework. At a minimum, this shall contain: (1) policy-based access control and role-based access control (RBAC) that allows users access while also restricting system access only to authorized users. RBAC will control the roles assigned, allow authorized users to take on specific roles (e.g. administrator), and exercise permission. (2) The system shall also utilize single sign-on (SSO) authentication and public key infrastructure (PKI) for authenticating users that access the system. (3) Lastly, the system shall provide audit logs and the ability for system administrators to provide key system level metrics. Secure application development practices shall be followed to minimize rework required to comply with DoD Information Assurance (IA) policies. Software provided shall successfully pass various security vulnerability scans such as Fortify, Nessus, and Burp in order to achieve authority to operate on operational networks. Also, the security services shall appropriately mark data per classification standards (e.g. Controlled Access Program Coordination Office (CAPCO) markings).</p>
<p><strong>2.4 User Experience Services:</strong> This system shall provide end users with a fully customizable enterprise experience. For instance, customizable dashboards shall be available once users sign-in to the system. Dashboards can also be developed for use by a specific community. The dashboard will serve as the main interface for the system and must be fully customizable to allow operators to search and select the data they need to see once the system is accessed and provide user-specified information (specific to the user's AOR) on their requested display (e.g. map, graph). The user interface shall also allow users to share data, files, and notes and provide a collaborative social workspace. This workspace will permit users to save and share queries and working files, create target folders on entities of interest, and provide a user workflow for publishing reports and documents. The workflow will allow users to create, review, update and delete reports and rely on role-based access control for permissions. The user will also be able to export reports and records as appropriate. Lastly, the user experience and interface shall be reusable and domain agnostic.</p>
<p><strong>2.5 Visualization Services</strong>: Users shall be able to access and visualize data through a myriad of methods. This BAA shall research how users interact with the user interface and develop novel visualization displays. Proposed approaches shall allow users to query the centralized database and output results to a diverse set of visualization displays. As data is selected, the visualization displays shall provide the full details on the data by displaying the data record. Typical displays include, but are not limited to table, report view, grid, graph, map (2D/3D, heatmap), timeline, and link analysis.</p>
<p><strong>2.6 Report Generator Services:</strong> Many times, users are required to develop a briefing or report to share and publish. The proposed approach shall provide a capability to automate this process, saving critical time that can be better spent analyzing data. This report generation capability shall allow users the ability to output their required data to different report types to include, but not limited to Microsoft PowerPoint, Excel, Word, and Adobe PDF.</p>
<p><strong>2.7 Mobile, Disconnected, and Disadvantaged Operations:</strong> The data framework and infrastructure designed and developed shall allow users to operate the software system from a mobile device. For users with little or no connectivity, the proposed approach shall allow users to still perform in an appropriate manner. Disconnected Operations shall allow users to have access to key capabilities of the system such as search and data entry with no connectivity. For disadvantaged users with little bandwidth, the system shall be able to execute in a lightweight manner so that users can still conduct critical functions.</p>

<p><strong>V. APPLICATION REVIEW INFORMATION:</strong></p>
<p>1. CRITERIA: The following criteria, which are listed in equal importance and will be used to determine whether white papers and proposals submitted are consistent with the intent of this BAA and of interest to the Government:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. Overall Scientific and Technical Merit - The soundness of approach for the development and/or enhancement of the proposed technology, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. Related Experience - The extent to which the offeror demonstrates relevant technology and domain knowledge, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c. Openness, Maturity and Assurance of Solution - The extent to which existing capabilities and standards are leveraged and the relative maturity of the proposed technology in terms of reliability and robustness, and <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d. Reasonableness and realism of proposed costs and fees (if any).</p>
<p>No further evaluation criteria will be used in selecting white papers/proposals. White papers and proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received.</p>
<p>2. REVIEW AND SELECTION PROCESS:</p>
<p>Only Government employees will evaluate the white papers/proposals for selection. The Air Force Research Laboratory's Information Directorate has contracted for various business and staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain administrative access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors. Administrative access is defined as "handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in the administrative support contract, which do not require the review, reading, and comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks." These contractors have signed general non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements. The required administrative access will be granted to non-technical professionals. Examples of the administrative tasks performed include: a. Assembling and organizing information for R&amp;D case files; b. Accessing library files for use by government personnel; and c. Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries. Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection.</p>
<p>3. ADEQUATE PRICE COMPETITION: The Government may simultaneously evaluate proposals received under this BAA with a common cutoff date for multiple offerors. In this case, the Government may make award based on adequate price competition, and offerors must be aware that there is a possibility of non-selection due to a proposal of similar but higher-priced technical approach as compared to another offeror.</p>
<p><br /><strong>VI. STEP TWO INFORMATION - REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL &amp; AWARD:</strong></p>
<p>1. AWARD NOTICES: Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Notification by email or letter will be sent by the technical POC. Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract. Those white papers not selected to submit a proposal will be notified in the same manner. Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.</p>
<p>For additional information, a copy of the AFRL "Broad Agency Announcement (BAA): Guide for Industry," Mar 2015, and Proposal Preparation Instructions, Dec 2014, may be accessed at: <a href="https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&amp;mode=form&amp;id=1cffad228f48b58057072a6c9113799d&amp;tab=core&amp;_cview=1">https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&amp;mode=form&amp;id=1cffad228f48b58057072a6c9113799d&amp;tab=<br />core&amp;_cview=1</a><br /><br />2. ADMINISTRATIVE AND NATIONAL POLICY REQUIREMENTS:</p>

AMDWS is the Force Operations (FO) component of the Air and Missile Defense Planning and Control System (AMDPCS) and the Air Defense Airspace Management (ADAM) Cell providing both planning and Situational Awareness of Air Defense assets.</p>
<p>This notice is published in accordance with FAR Parts 10.002 and 15.201 and is a Request for Information (RFI) only in support of market research. All information received will be used for planning purposes only. This notice does not constitute Invitation for Bids, Request for Proposals, or Request for Quotes. The Government will not award a contract based on this notice and will not reimburse respondents for any cost associated with responses to it.</p>
<p>PROBLEM STATEMENT: AMDWS is the Air Defense component for AMDPCS, ADAM Cell, and Army Mission Command (MC). AMDWS is also the gateway between the Air and Missile Defense (AMD) Force and the Maneuver Commander. Interoperability with MC, Joint and Multinational systems will be maintained and extended to enable collaborative planning and situational awareness through tactical graphics and staff element overlays. The U.S. Army will update AMDWS with regulatory changes required to maintain interoperability with the Air Operations Center (AOC) and the Command, Control, Battle Management and Communications (C2BMC). The AMDWS system will retrieve, fuse, and distribute this time-sensitive information to support operator inputs necessary for decision cycle dominance at all AMD Echelons. The AMDWS user interface will enable display of the near real time situation to allow the primary FO mission of monitoring the situation, assessing the situation, conducting planning, and directing and controlling forces to be performed easily. The fusion of the current Battlespace picture on AMDWS is an enabler as the primary Common Operating Picture (COP) within the ADAM Cell, AMDPCS, and Forward Operating Bases (FOBs). The AMDWS operates at SECRET classification level and requires compliance with the DOD Information Assurance Certification and Accreditation Program (DIACAP).</p>

            <title><![CDATA[PRESOL - Maintenance of ArcGIS licenses used for NATO Core GIS]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[Department of Commerce - The NATO Communications and Information Agency (NCI Agency) intends to issue an Invitation for Bid (IFB) for the provision of standard software maintenance of ArcGIS licenses used for NATO Core GIS (Geographic Information Systems).
<p>NCI Agency is responsible for the in-service support of major NATO Communications and Information Systems, some of which are under the management and monitoring of the Joint Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance (JISR) Service Line (SL), which is located at The Hague (Netherlands). The JISR SL is responsible for the management, monitoring, and maintenance of the NATO core GIS.</p>
<p>Potential U.S. prime contractors must 1) be pre-approved for participation in NATO International Competitive Bidding (ICB) and 2) be nominated to the bidders list by the U.S. Government.</p>
<p>The reference for the IFB is IFB-NCIA-JISR-15-07 and all correspondence concerning the IFB should reference this number.</p>
<p>It is planned to place a single contract for the entire scope of work. No partial bidding will be allowed.</p>
<p>SUMMARY OF REQUIREMENTS</p>
<p>Please see attached.</p>
<p>BECOMING ELIGIBLE TO BID</p>
<p>NATO ICB requires that the U.S. Government nominate U.S. prime contractors to the bidders list. Before the U.S. Government can nominate a U.S. prime contractor to the bidders list, however, the firm must&nbsp;be approved for participation in NATO ICB. Firms are approved for NATO ICB on a facility-by-facility basis.</p>
<p>The NATO ICB application is a one-time application. The application requires supporting documentation in the form of 1) a company resume indicating contracts completed as a prime contractor and 2) an annual report or set of financial documents indicating compilation, review, or audit by an independent CPA.</p>
<p>U.S. firms can download a copy of the U.S. NATO ICB application from the following website:</p>
<p>http://www.bis.doc.gov/index.php/other-areas/strategic-industries-and-economic-security-sies/nato-related-business-opportunities</p>
<p>The application and supporting documentation may be submitted as e-mail attachments. If, when submitting the application, your firm is interested in a specific NATO ICB project, please include the following in the text of your email:</p>
<p>- the title and/or solicitation number of the project<br />- the name/phone/FAX/email of the point of contact for the bid documents</p>
<p>After approval of your one-time NATO ICB application, the U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC) will then know to follow up by issuing a Declaration of Eligibility (DOE) for that project.

            <title><![CDATA[PRESOL - NATO International Competitive Bidding (ICB): Upgrade Geographic Information Services Increment 3]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[Department of Commerce - The NATO Communications and Information Agency (NCI Agency) intends to issue an Invitation for Bid (IFB) in relation to the implementation of the project "Upgrade Geographic Information Services Increment 3 - CP9C0150".
<p>The scope of this upcoming opportunity is anticipated to be an upgrade of the Core GIS system addressing deficiencies and new requirements; upgrading the software baseline provided under Increment 2; ensuring common functional capability across all Core GIS sites; making Core GIS compatible with DCIS and furthermore, meeting the requirements of the Bi-SC Service Employment in Support of the NATO Command Structure.</p>
<p>Potential U.S. prime contractors must 1) hold a facility security clearance at the level of SECRET or higher, 2) be pre-approved for participation in NATO International Competitive Bidding (ICB) and 3) be nominated to the bidders list by the U.S. Government.</p>
<p>The reference for the IFB is IFB-CO-14179-GIS and all correspondence concerning the IFB should reference this number.</p>
<p>It is planned to award a single firm-fixed price contract for the entire scope of work with an expected duration of 16 months and follow on contract options for Spiral 2, for additional sites in Kosovo and Afghanistan as well as for 2 additional years of warranty. No partial bidding will be allowed.</p>
<p>SUMMARY OF REQUIREMENTS</p>
<p>Please see attached. These requirements are being refined and detailed as part of the<br />preparation of the IFB.</p>
<p>BECOMING ELIGIBLE TO BID</p>
<p>NATO ICB requires that the U.S. Government nominate U.S. prime contractors to the bidders list. Before the U.S. Government can nominate a U.S. prime contractor to the bidders list, however, the firm must be approved for participation in NATO ICB. Firms are approved for NATO ICB on a facility-by-facility basis.</p>
<p>The NATO ICB application is a one-time application. The application requires supporting documentation in the form of 1) a company resume indicating contracts completed as a prime contractor and 2) an annual report or set of financial documents indicating compilation, review, or audit by an independent CPA.</p>
<p>U.S. firms can download a copy of the U.S. NATO ICB application from the following website:</p>
<p>http://www.bis.doc.gov/index.php/other-areas/strategic-industries-and-economic-security-sies/nato-related-business-opportunities</p>
<p>The application and supporting documentation may be submitted as e-mail attachments. If, when submitting the application, your firm is interested in a specific NATO ICB project, please include the following in the text of your email:</p>
<p>- the title and/or solicitation number of the project<br />- the name/phone/FAX/email of the point of contact for the bid documents</p>
<p>After approval of your one-time NATO ICB application, the U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC) will then know to follow up by issuing a Declaration of Eligibility (DOE) for that project. NATO member governments use a DOE to nominate an approved firm to the bidders list for a particular NATO ICB project.</p>
<p>IMPORTANT DATES:</p>
<p>- Request from DOC that a DOE be issued (and, for firms new to NATO ICB, submit the completed one-time NATO ICB application): 25 February 2016<br /><br />- IFB issued (target): April 2016</p>
<p>- Bid Closing (target) : July 2016</p>
<p>- Contract Award (target): November 2016</p>]]></description>

The projects shall have been performed for the U.S. Military, for an A-E fee of $400,000.00 or more for each project, and completed within the 10 years immediately preceding the date of issuance of this notice. Projects that comply with the requirements of UFC 2-100-01 Installation Master Planning and the NAVFAC Installation Development Plan Consistency Guide or Marine Corps Order 11000.12 Real Property Facilities Manual, Facilities Planning and Programming will be evaluated more favorably.
 Projects for the U.S. Navy or U.S. Marine Corps will be evaluated more favorably than projects completed for other branches of the U.S. military or other government agencies. Projects within the Pacific and Indian Ocean areas will be evaluated more favorably than projects conducted in other geographic regions. Specialized experience of the prime firm will be evaluated more favorably than that of the subconsultants. 

Ensure that each project cited is either a standalone contract for a single tasking or a single task/delivery order on an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity contract.  If more than five projects are provided, only the first five will be considered. Projects that have not been completed will be excluded from evaluation consideration.
 
2.	Professional Qualifications of Key Personnel.
   Firms will be evaluated on professional qualifications and competence of the proposed key personnel to provide services to accomplish tasks required under this contract.

SUBMISSION REQUIREMENT (SF330 Part 1 Sections E, G, and D): 
a.	Key Personnel Resumes:  Provide resumes for a maximum of four key personnel (Project Manager, Senior Planner, Planner, GIS Specialist) to be assigned to this contract.  For each key personnel, identify active professional registration or certification, area of expertise and demonstrated experience, role expected to play in this contract, and describe the roles they performed in a maximum of five completed U.S. Military projects  relevant to Selection Criterion 1.
 Ensure that each project cited is either a standalone contract for a single tasking, or a single task/delivery order on an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity contract.

 The chart shall be submitted on a single 11” x 17” sized sheet and use a font size of 10 points or larger.  Resumes of personnel providing supporting services (items a through s above) are not required and will not be evaluated.
3.   Past Performance.  A-E firms will be evaluated based on past performance on projects relevant to selection criterion (1) above with Government agencies and private industry in terms of cost control, quality of work, and compliance with performance schedules.  Past performance information not related to the projects related selection criterion (1) will not be considered.  The A-E shall provide ACASS performance documentation or similar for each project.  If an ACASS performance documentation or similar for each project is not available, provide a Performance Survey (download from the NECO website) and submit the Survey with the SF330).
  The Performance Survey shall be from the contracting agent and/or their representative responsible for the contract administration, or from the facility owner/user.  It shall not be from the prime contractor on a project nor shall it be from a prime contractor to a subcontractor.  If the A-E received any less than satisfactory past performance evaluations from customers/owners, it is incumbent upon the A-E to provide an explanation of the rating and what the A-E has done or will do to preclude less than satisfactory ratings on future contracts.  In evaluating past performance, the Government may consider information in the A-E’s SF330 and information gathered from other sources including former customers, Government agencies, federal databases and other references.
  The info provided by the A-E may provide the major portion of the information used in the Governments evaluation for past performance.  The Government, however, is not restricted to the information provided by the Offeror and may use other sources to assess  past performance info such as the Past Performance Info Retrieval System (PPIRS), A-E Contract Administration Support System (ACASS), and inquiries with previous customers/owners. 

SUBMISSION REQUIREMENT: (SF330, Part 1, Section H).  If an A-E is utilizing past performance information of affiliates/subsidiaries/parent /LLC/LTD member companies, the proposal shall clearly demonstrate that the affiliate/subsidiary/parent/LLC/LTD member companies will have meaningful involvement in the performance of the contract in order for the past performance info of the affiliate/subsidiary/parent/LLC/LTD member companies to be considered.
  

The information submitted shall state specific commitments of technical resources (e.g. personnel, equipment) that the affiliate/subsidiary/parent/LLC/LTD member companies will commit to the performance of this contract.  In particular, the submitted information will clearly state the specific commitments of resources of the affiliate/subsidiary/parent/LLC/LTD member that will perform the contract requirements.  The SF330 shall also describe specific roles of the affiliate/subsidiary/parent/LLC/LTD member companies in terms of the work it will either self-perform or manage on behalf of the A-E for future task orders in performance of the contract.  A subcontractors or subconsultants past performance will not be given the same level of consideration as either the prime contractor or the joint venture partner because there is no direct legal relationship between the Government and the subcontractor/subconsultant.

The Government will consider the past performance and experience of a subcontractor/subconsultant where the prime contractor provides, in its SF330, evidence of a binding teaming agreement or other contractual agreement which creates legal responsibility on the part of the prime contractor and the subcontractor/subconsultant to enter into a subcontract.
 However, the level of consideration will depend on the extent to which the A-E demonstrates the prime contractors commitment to award a subcontract to the subcontractor/subconsultant and subcontractors/subconsultants commitment to enter into a subcontract with the prime contractor, including legal accountability for both parties.  Prime contractor-subcontractor/subconsultant teams/Joint Ventures/LLCs/LTDs with a demonstrated history of working successfully together on prior projects may be considered more favorably than those without such history.

4.	Capacity to accomplish the work in the required time. 

SUBMISSION REQUIREMENT:  (SF330, Part 1, Section H).  Describe the proposed team’s ability to complete several large and small task orders concurrently requiring quick turnaround.
  Describe the firm’s ability to perform and manage multiple complex projects in different locations and the ability to surge to meet unexpected demands.
Describe the firm’s ability to provide qualified backup staffing for key personnel to ensure continuity of service with minimal disruption to projects initiated under other NAVFAC PAC contracts/task orders. Indicate the firm’s current workload and the availability of the prime and subconsultants for the specified performance period.

5.	Quality Control Program. 

SUBMISSION REQUIREMENT:  (SF330, Part 1, Section H).  Briefly describe how the prime ensures quality consistently across the entire team and how quality of subcontractors work is assured.
  Briefly describe internal quality assurance procedures and indicate effectiveness. Address the team’s QC processes for checking documents for errors, omissions and quality and incorporating and tracking review comments.

6.	A-E Firm’s Location: A-E firms will be evaluated on the locations of the office or offices from which the A-E firm will perform the work under this contract.  Locations within the general geographical area of the work and knowledge of the locality of the work (e.g., Hawaii, Guam, and other areas within the NAVFAC Pacific AOR) will be evaluated. 

SUBMISSION REQUIREMENT:  (SF330, Part 1, Section H).  Indicate the location of the office that will be performing the work including sub-consultants offices.
  Describe and illustrate the team’s knowledge of the geographical area (e.g., Hawaii, Guam, and other areas within the NAVFAC Pacific AOR).  Address ability of the firm to ensure timely response to requests for on site support.   

7.	Volume of Work: A-E firms will be evaluated in terms of work previously awarded to the A-E firm by Department of Defense (DoD) within the past 12 months, with the objective of effecting an equitable distribution of Department of Defense A-E contracts among qualified A-E firms and firms that have not had Department of Defense contracts.

SUBMISSION REQUIREMENT: (SF330, Part 1, Section H).  Provide a list of DoD contracts or task orders awarded in the past 12 months.
  Include dollar amount for each contract/task order awarded.  If the firm performed work as a subcontractor, indicate the contract and/or task order of the prime contractor and the estimated amount completed as the subcontractor.  A-E firms with multiple offices shall indicate which branch office completed each project.

Offerors are encouraged to view the responses to all questions and comments, including those submitted by other organizations.   For technical questions/comments, offerors should reference the topic number in order to better direct and respond to topic questions.</p>
<p>Finally, offerors must periodically check the FEDBIZOPPS for amendments regarding updates or changes to the BIG BAA.  These updates will be made via announcements, additional or revised document postings, or responses to questions/comments made via the Q&amp;A function.  Offerors are responsible for maintaining awareness of BAA updates via the ARC as there will be no other source for announcement of updates or changes to the BAA other than the ARC.</p>

However, FDA reserves the right to contact vendors if additional information is required.</p>
<p>The FDA is requesting comments on the draft SOW from both large and small businesses. Comments from all sized firms are welcome.  In addition, the purpose of this RFI is twofold:  first, to determine the acquisition strategy regarding small business participation, and second, to obtain industry comments on the draft Statement of Work (SOW).

            <description><![CDATA[Other Defense Agencies - Requirement:
<p>SOCOM needs the capability to locally manage &amp; disseminate its foundation, map, and imagery (geospatial) data throughout the SOCOM AOR. SOCOM needs to provide current/relevant/updated/near real-time geospatial data (vector, raster, and elevation) to SOCOM geospatial customers within a two hour timeframe (upon notification) on multiple deployable external data drives (SD card, thumb drive, external hard drive) and domains (SIPR, NIPR). Data to be disseminated needs to be selectable via a Graphical User Interface using a "rubber-band" style selection tool and a Map of the region of the world involved. Once selected, the size of the potential data to be transferred to the external drive will be displayed so that a decision can be made to transfer the data or redraw the area to be transferred, or if there are multiple layers, determine which layers are not necessary, prior to transfer being initiated. The solution needs to be capable of managing and disseminating large volumes of geospatial data &lt;&lt;definition of large volume?&gt;&gt; over the network to include bandwidth-disadvantaged users operating on SOF Deployable Network - Medium/Light (SDN-M/L). Access to the data needs to be obtained using map/imagery data software and /or web browser.</p>
<p>Solution needs to be Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) interoperable with map &amp; imagery displaying software and provide Keyhole Markup Language (KML) services. The solution must allow for seamless integration and usage with GOTS/COTS exploitation and visualization software and tools. These must include FalconView, RemoteView, SOCET GXP, ArcGIS, ENVI, Google Earth, Palantir, ERDAS and the Global Command and Control System (GCCS). Additionally, the solution must allow for user defined outputs to all DoD standard geospatial formats, to include, NITF, GEOTIFF, MRSID, PNG, JPEG2000, JPG, ERDAS.IMG, and others.<br />The solution must provide the ability to generate custom deployable drives containing data and web services (KML and OGC) for disconnected users. SOF users and analysts often operate in austere locations with limited or non-existent connectivity. Upon CIF deployment analysts must have the ability to conduct planning and analysis en-route to operational location without communication infrastructure. Having a self-contained, deployable drive that can provide OGC and KML services to disconnected, mobile, and multiple users is paramount. Data managers must be able to create a drive which is usable by COTS/GOTS tools that are KML and OGC compliant.</p>
<p>The solution must have the ability to provide real-time updating of existing data layers without disrupting live services. It must allow the on-site data manager to seamlessly upload, patch, and update foundation base layers without disconnecting access to web services or requiring the data source to be modified and/or replaced. The solution must allow on-site analysts to maintain the data and serve as the data manager with limited excessive effort. The solution should provide a reduced data management option that simplifies maintenance/updates and still maintains optimum performance.</p>
<p>Justification:</p>
<p>Currently, SOCOM doesn't have this capability resident at the Enterprise level. Each TSOC and component are researching and attempting to fund solutions independently, with at least one organization that currently funds this capability themselves to meet their mission requirements. The current Enterprise mapping arch is insufficient to meet the current and future needs of the enterprise. During the GEOINT WG in April 2014 at SOCOM, all of the TSOCs and Components present echoed their desire to gain a similar capability.</p>
<p>As of today, the SOCOM organizations do not have a capability that meets their enterprise and disconnected requirement to provide GEOINT data and visualization services to tactical SOF operations.</p>
<p>Who requires service/system?<br />TSOCs, SOCOM Components, a SOCOM Enterprise need</p>
<p>Estimated Number of People Affected?<br />Significant</p>
<p>Which network will the service or system be applied? <br />SIPR/NIPR</p>]]></description>
