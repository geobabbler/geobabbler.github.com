    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Back in May, I had the honor of being appointed to the newly established Maryland Council on Open Data. The Council had its inaugural meeting in Baltimore yesterday and was heavily attended, including attendance by Governor Martin O'Malley. I'll discuss his remarks to the group later.</p>

<p>As the first meeting of a new group, it went off largely as I expected. The agenda consisted primarily of an overview of the establishing legislation, a review of ethics requirements, demos of the existing open data portals, discussion of the history of open data in Maryland, and remarks from the Governor.</p>

<p>I won't go into details about the make-up of the Council, but they can be found here <a href="http://msa.maryland.gov/msa/mdmanual/25ind/html/53opendata.html">http://msa.maryland.gov/msa/mdmanual/25ind/html/53opendata.html</a>. Nor will I do a deep dive into the legislation, but it can be found here: <a href="http://mgaleg.maryland.gov/2014RS/chapters_noln/Ch_69_sb0644T.pdf">http://mgaleg.maryland.gov/2014RS/chapters_noln/Ch_69_sb0644T.pdf</a> (PDF). I will instead focus on my take-aways from the meeting itself.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>First, the establishing legislation makes data in Maryland open by default, unless it falls under certain criteria (personally identifiable information, law enforcement sensitive, etc.). Second, it is in fact legislation. Previous open data initiatives (MSGIC Executive Committee and the Maryland Open Data Working Group), were established by executive order. As a result, they were vulnerable to reversal by subsequent administrations and they had no real effect on other branches of government. Because of the new legislation, the open data has greater durability and active, enthusiastic participation from the state legislature.</p>

<p>So the new Council unifies the previous efforts and has top cover from the legislation. That can only be a good thing. The state currently has two open data portals: an <a href="http://data.imap.maryland.gov/">Esri Open Data portal</a> for geospatial data and a <a href="https://data.maryland.gov/">Socrata portal</a> for everything else. In practice, the lines between them may not be so distinct, but that's the stated role of each.</p>

<p>It is clear that open data is important to the Governor. Since his days as the Mayor of Baltimore, he has been known as a data-driven executive. The "CityStat" concept in Baltimore evolved into "StateStat" when he moved to Annapolis. It is widely known that data and metrics back everything his administration does. Open data is the other side of the coin. It is the mechanism by which the supporting data and metrics of the state government are made public.</p>

<p>In his remarks, the Governor highlighted Maryland's top ranking (shared by six states) in the <a href="http://www.datainnovation.org/2014/08/state-open-data-policies-and-portals/">Center for Data Innovation report of August 18, 2014</a> but then quickly addressed the remaining weaknesses identified. Specifically, he discussed:</p>

<ul>
<li>Reporting on spending data</li>
<li>The need for a more complete picture of all data sets</li>
<li>The need for better minimum metadata standards</li>
<li>The need for a uniform standard for giving citizens access to public information</li>
</ul>


<p>These are all fairly easy to address on the surface. In the open discussion that followed, the theme that I took away was "culture." Maryland has the policy framework and a good start on a technical framework to more fully open its data. The hard work, as it always is, is transforming the culture. As the requirements for opening data begin to trickle down into the daily lives of the people handling information, I think a lot of workflows will change. I also suspect some of the standards chosen for achieving compliance with open data requirements will facilitate significant changes to technical architectures in individual departments. In short, the proverbial onion will part to get peeled.</p>

<p>It's a lot of work and it won't happen quickly. I am excited for the opportunity to participate. I have worked in the private sector for my entire career (although in professional services to the government), so this is my first foray into anything resembling being on the public sector side of things. I expect I'll have a lot to learn.</p>

<p>My interest in open data has been somewhat spurred by the infrastructure data contraction that occurred in the mid-2000s in reaction to domestic security concerns. I felt it was the wrong direction to go then and I don't think making data harder to acquire really helped anyone. I'm looking forward to seeing what we can do on the Council to achieve the benefits other states, like Arkansas, have achieved through opening data rather than closing it off.</p>

    <link href="http://blog.geomusings.com/2013/10/07/maryland-department-of-planning-bundles-property-data-with-qgis/"/>
    <updated>2013-10-07T12:38:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.geomusings.com/2013/10/07/maryland-department-of-planning-bundles-property-data-with-qgis</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This past week, I got an e-mail from Jim Cannistra, Director of Data Planning Services and the <a href="http://www.mdp.state.md.us/home.shtml">Maryland Department of Planning</a> (MDP), alerting me to a new product available from MDP called <a href="http://www.mdp.state.md.us/OurProducts/PropertyMapProducts/FINDERProduct.shtml">FINDER Quantum</a>. This product bundles Maryland property data and related products with <a href="http://qgis.org">QGIS</a> software to provide users with a fully-functional, free-standing system for interacting with the data. It is designed to replace an older, custom software product, capitalizing on an industry-standard open-source system.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>From the MDP site, the bundled data includes:</p>

<blockquote cite="http://www.mdp.state.md.us/OurProducts/PropertyMapProducts/FINDERProduct.shtml">The product DVD includes the State's computerized property (tax) maps; the x,y linkages (point or polygon) to the Parcel, Computer Assisted Mass Appraisal (CAMA) and Sale datasets; Parcel, CAMA and Sale data, including Sale data via download from the Subscriber Website, from the Maryland State Department of Assessments and Taxation (SDAT); reference grids including a grid for the property (tax) maps, an ADC map book grid, a grid for the Maryland State Highway Administration (SHA) road, stream and feature maps and a grid for USGS 7.5' Topographical quad maps; and additional SHA files including a digital centerline roads file, data derived from SHA digital grid maps, an SHA major roads file and a county boundary file.<br/>
<br/>
Also included are land use/land cover data; congressional and legislative district boundary files; census geography and census demographic data; ZIP code boundary files; Priority Funding Area (PFA) designations; floodplain data, including DFIRM data for selected jurisdictions; protected lands boundaries; watershed data; generalized zoning designations; sewer service area boundaries; public water service area boundaries for selected jurisdictions; National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) Maryland coverage; residential Sales x,y point and summary files derived from SDAT Parcel and Sale data; large-scale, high resolution color digital-ortho imagery and a custom Quantum GIS project file (.qgs).</blockquote>


<p>The MDP site indicates there is a <a href="http://www.mdp.state.md.us/pdf/OurProducts/PropertyMapProducts/Finder/CstFnd.pdf">licensing fee</a> (PDF), which I assume is to cover the management of the data sets and the <a href="http://www.mdp.state.md.us/pdf/OurProducts/PropertyMapProducts/Finder/LicFnd.pdf">license agreement</a>, while acknowledging the GPL license of QGIS itself, seems to place the actual FINDER extension itself outide of any open-source license. (I am not a lawyer so I'll accept guidance on that interpretation.) That said, bundling QGIS with data that the statewide user community values and an application to help exploit it is a great way to get more users on board with QGIS.</p>

<p>To that end, users that choose to take advantage of FINDER Quantum will want to keep in mind that great <a href="http://www.esrgc.org/training/">QGIS-related resources</a> are available via <a href="http://www.salisbury.edu/geography/">Salisbury State University</a> and that training is also available from <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=14036437">Randal Hale</a> of <a href="http://www.northrivergeographic.com/introduction-to-quantum-gis">North River Geographics</a>. Once you have this powerful application installed, you can start to tap into a <a href="http://boundlessgeo.com/solutions/solutions-software/quantum-gis/">deep pool</a> of <a href="http://www.osgeo.org/search_profile">resources</a> to build your expertise.</p>

<p>So kudos to MDP for bundling their data with a powerful mapping, visualization, and analysis tool in QGIS. I hope that, in the near future, MDP considers making the FINDER application itself open-source but this is a great first step.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I spent the day yesterday at <a href="http://www.towson.edu/">Towson University</a> attending the <a href="http://www.towson.edu/tugis/">TUGIS 2013</a> conference. The new one-day format was a firehose that showcased the diversity of geospatial work occurring across the State of Maryland. The keynote by <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=44978536">Learon Dalby</a> was well-received and the content of the conference was generally substantive. While the day was a sprint, there was one workshop that really caught my attention more so than I would have thought from its title.</p>

<p>The photo below shows 40 participants of an "Introduction to Free and Open Source GIS Software" workshop getting hands-on experience with <a href="http://www.qgis.org">QGIS</a> and <a href="http://www.postgis.org">PostGIS</a> by working through prepared but realistic scenarios. These scenarios included doing multi-user editing and performing spatial analysis to assess the effects of a potential toxic release over a small town.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"> <img src="http://blog.geomusings.com/images/posts/tugis2013_workshop.jpg" /></p>

<p>The workshop was put together by <a href="http://faculty.salisbury.edu/~ajlembo/">Dr. Arthur Lembo</a> of <a href="http://www.salisbury.edu/">Salisbury University</a> and conducted by him and a team of his students, who not only led portions of the workshop but were also stationed around the room to provide guidance to participants. The scenarios were prepared in printed workbooks that the participants were free to take with them, along with information about how to download the tools. All-in-all, I thought the workshop was very well-designed and presented a thorough overview of the capabilities of these two tools.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>To be sure, the workshop was not all unicorns and rainbows. There were typical glitches such as file system and database permission issues that required on-the-fly adjustments, which Dr. Lembo and his students handled well. Some participants were clearly stumped at points while others were making good headway with the examples.</p>

<p>Many of the participants probably remain committed <a href="http://www.esri.com">ArcGIS</a> users after the workshop while others may very well dig in and more thoroughly explore QGIS and PostGIS, but that's really beside the point. Regardless of what the individual participants decide to do with the information from the workshop, all left with hands-on exposure to the tools that was presented in a manner that was free of hyperbole, FUD, or market-speak. They now have more first-hand information with which to make their own educated decisions as to how they want to proceed with their geospatial technology choices; and that, in my opinion, may have been the most valuable outcome of the workshop.</p>

    <link href="http://blog.geomusings.com/2013/03/18/off-to-tugis/"/>
    <updated>2013-03-18T12:40:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.geomusings.com/2013/03/18/off-to-tugis</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Tomorrow, I'll be heading up to the <a href="http://www.towson.edu/tugis/">Towson University GIS (TUGIS) conference</a> with 500 or so of my closest Maryland geo-friends. It has been restructured into a one-day event and the program seems to be very content-rich as a result. I am particularly happy to see more open-source content this year. There's an intro session featuring <a href="http://www.postgresql.org">PostgreSQL</a>, <a href="http://www.postgis.org">PostGIS</a>, <a href="http://qgis.org">QGIS</a>, and <a href="http://geoserver.org">GeoServer</a> presented by <a href="http://www.salisbury.edu/">Salisbury State University</a>. Salisbury was once known as a bastion of <a href="http://www.manifold.net/">Manifold</a> so they've got a long history of thinking outside the Arc. Additionally, there is a session (by Towson University) discussing the use of <a href="http://www.gdal.org">GDAL</a>, <a href="http://www.gdal.org/ogr/">OGR</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/sgillies/shapely">Shapely</a> in the development of a spatial service.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"> <img src="http://blog.geomusings.com/images/mdflag.png" alt="Brian Timoney's favorite state flag" title="Brian Timoney's favorite state flag" /></p>

<p>One thing I like about regional GIS conferences like this is that they tend to focus more on solutions to real-world problems instead of the latest technological bells and whistles. I spend so much of my time with my head in Federal requirements that it's nice do a reset and get different perspectives on how geospatial technologies are used. I am particularly interested to hear the keynote from <a href="http://twitter.com/learondalby">Learon Dalby</a> of <a href="http://www.sanborn.com/">Sanborn</a> and formerly of the <a href="http://www.gis.state.ar.us/">Arkansas GIO office</a>. I had the pleasure of working with Learon and the AGIO team on a project a couple of years ago and am impressed with what they accomplished.</p>

<p>I appreciate the new format of TUGIS as a one-day event is much easier to fit into the schedule. I'm looking forward to it.</p>
