  <div class="entry-content"><p>I spent last week in San Diego at the ESRI International User Conference. It was a bit different for me since I was working <a href="http://www.zekiah.com">Zekiah&#8217;s</a> booth most of the time. I did, however, make it out to a SIG and a couple of technical workshops. Additionally, some of our technical staff were there and had feedback on the sessions. What follows is a very high-level summary of my week.</div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>My blogging has been slower this time around because I&#8217;ve been doing a lot of booth duty. This is my thrid conference this year and some of our other staff are getting to go to the sessions. I did, however, go to the SQL Server SIG a little while ago.</p>

<p>Ed Katibah had a few tricks up his sleeve. First off, he dropped the news that, as of 11:00am, SQL Server 2008 is now in RTM. Very soon, the final version will be in our hands. That&#8217;s great news to everyone who has been working with the CTPs and RCs.</p>

<p>Ed had few other nuggets. He described the stress-testing that SQL 2008 has undergone. In short, there has been about 375,000 hours of stress testing run against SQL 2008 so we should be able to expect it to be solid. Additionally, Microsoft has already been running on SQL 2008 for &#8220;a few months.&#8221; To me, this is all great news that makes me feel even more confident about the product (which already had my confidence). When I first installed the November CTP, I felt that much of the platform was already production-ready but more testing and use can&#8217;t have hurt.</p>

<p>Ed went on to describe the two spatial types and reationale for doing that. That discussion is well documented and I fall in the &#8220;it&#8217;s a good thing category&#8221; mainly because of previous work with applications that had over-the-horizon requirements.</p>

<p>Ed gave props to Paul Ramsey during his talk when explaining the XY switching debate. It was great to see that kind of respect on display.</p>

<p>Some nuts and bolts: SQL 2008 limits spatial objects to about 250 million vertices. This greatly exceeds Ed&#8217;s largest test case, which is a high-res vector data set of the world&#8217;s oceans. Polygons are limited to about 65,000 holes. I think those limits leave a lot of wiggle room. He also discussed the significance of coordinate ordering for the geography data type. Basically, it&#8217;s counter-clockwise for outer rings and clockwise for inner rings. This is consistent with implementations in Informix, DB2 and Oracle (those are what he mentioned). He did mention that this was an industry consensus but there was no official specification on this matter. Ed also mentioned it may be a topic of future discussion for OGC.</p>

<p>Ed also demonstrated the spatial results window in the SQL management Studio. This is a really nice tool that lets you visualize the results of your spatial SQL inside the management studio. As a developer, that will be a huge help because I won&#8217;t have to do a test run to see if I got the query right. Ed just saved me a bunch of time!</p>

<p>Ed went on to announce a companion CodePlex site for SQL Server 2008 spatial tools: <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/sqlspatialtools">www.codeplex.com/SqlSpatialTools</a>. There are already some tools that Isaac has posted but Ed said that other tools will include shapefile and KML converters. The site will also be open to contribs from the community. All of the tools currently there were developed using the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/isaac/archive/2008/05/30/our-upcoming-builder-api.aspx">Builder API</a> and full source code is available so they serve has great examples of working with the Builder API.</p>

<p>All in all, it was a great talk. Ed&#8217;s one of the nicest guys ever and he is having a lot of fun with ArcSDE on SQL Server 2008.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Steven Citron-Pousty gave a talk on PostGIS and has helpfully posted his slides <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/scitronpousty/using-post-gis-to-add-some-spatial-flavor-to-your-application">here</a>. It&#8217;s a good introductory overview and provides some good examples of basic spatial SQL in PostGIS.</p>

<p>With ArcGIS Server now supporting PostgreSQL as a back end RDBMS and also supporting the use of PostGIS geometries, a lot of new users may be migrating to the PostgreSQL platform. This presentation is a good overview for anyone picking it up for the first time. Thanks, @TheSteve0!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://abegillespie.blogspot.com">Abe</a> has announced that the source code for zigGIS is now available (governed by the zigGIS EULA). It can be found at <a href="http://www.obtusesoft.com/source.aspx">http://www.obtusesoft.com/source.aspx</a>.</p>

<p>Additionally, there is now zigGIS apparel available at <a href="http://www.cafepress.com/obtusesoft">http://www.cafepress.com/obtusesoft</a> (just because it&#8217;s fun&#8230;and a little geeky).</p>

<p>No, there is not an option to have the source code printed on a shirt.</p>

<p>Enjoy both&#8230;.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This isn&#8217;t a huge surprise but <a href="http://support.esri.com/index.cfm?fa=knowledgebase.documentation.viewDoc&amp;PID=66&amp;MetaID=1430">this announcement</a> made it official a couple of days ago.</p>

<p>Basically, you&#8217;ll need to use ArcGIS Server&#8217;s server-side geocoding because the next release of ArcSDE won&#8217;t include it. The PDF attached to the announcement gives more detail. I know we had moved away from ArcSDE geocoding some time ago because it didn&#8217;t hold up to the load we were putting on it. We used Oracle Spatial instead.</p>

<p>But, if you&#8217;ve got any apps that are still using ArcSDE for geocoding, now&#8217;s the time the transition.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In case you missed it, ESRI as posted the <a href="http://blogs.esri.com/Dev/blogs/holistictesting/">ArcGIS 9.4 holistic testing schedule</a>. The schedule currently runs through the end of April 2009 but doesn&#8217;t give any hints of a release date.</p>

<p>So, just in time for the UC next week, you can begin to think about 9.4. If you want to get involved with it, now&#8217;s your chance.</p>

<p>Hopefully, I&#8217;ll see a lot of you next week.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Typically, I try not to directly mix work and blogging but here goes:</p>

<p>If you&#8217;ve poked around my blog enough, you know that I&#8217;m a partner at <a href="http://www.zekiah.com">Zekiah Technologies</a> in <a href="http://http://maps.google.com/maps?sourceid=navclient&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;rlz=1T4GGIH_enUS258US258&amp;q=la+plata,MD&amp;um=1&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=geocode_result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=title">La Plata, MD</a>. We are currently looking for up to four .Net developers to support various projects. ESRI development experience is a plus. Depending on the project, you could find yourself working with ArcGIS Server, ArcIMS, ArcSDE, Oracle, SQL Server, PostgreSQL. Some of the projects are supporting systems that have been in place for a while and require migration from older technologies. All will involve the development of new capability.</p>

<p>Once again, work location may vary depending upon the project but it will either be in <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?sourceid=navclient&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;rlz=1T4GGIH_enUS258US258&amp;q=Dahlgren+va&amp;um=1&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=geocode_result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=title">Dahlgren</a>, <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?sourceid=navclient&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;rlz=1T4GGIH_enUS258US258&amp;q=norfolk+va&amp;um=1&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=geocode_result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=title">Norfolk </a>or <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?sourceid=navclient&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;rlz=1T4GGIH_enUS258US258&amp;q=reston+va&amp;um=1&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=geocode_result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=title">Reston</a> in Virginia (especially Dahlgren). We are a consulting company that does development and implementation for our customers. For these positions, customer requirements specify US citizenship. Foreign travel may be required.</p>

<p>I chose to blog about this because I and all of my partners will be at the ESRI User Conference in San Diego and it seemed like it might be a convenient place to talk since so many people will be there. We will be staffing booth 612 so feel free to stop by if you&#8217;re interested.</p>

<p>For those who read this and may be thinking this way: we are not at liberty to sub-contract any of these positions.</p>

<p>Feel free to contact me via e-mail if you have any questions: bill@zekiah.com</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Now that <a href="http://www.esri.com">ArcGIS 9.3</a> has been finalized, I have finally gotten around to testing <a href="http://www.obtusesoft.com">zigGIS</a> 2.0.1 with it. While the source code is available, I wanted to test the unmodified binary distro. I am happy to report that zigGIS appears to work fine with ArcGIS Desktop 9.3.</p>

<p><a href="http://geobabble.files.wordpress.com/2008/07/ziggis_arcgis_93.png"><img alt="" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-207" height="186" src="http://geobabble.files.wordpress.com/2008/07/ziggis_arcgis_93.png?w=300" width="300" /></a></p>

<p>I guess the statement in the zigGIS About box regarding 9.2 is no longer accurate.  :D</p>

<p>I ran some preliminary tests on the editing capability and they seem to work fine. I was able to create a feature in ArcGIS, connect to my <a href="http://postgis.refractions.net">PostGIS</a> database using <a href="http://www.gvsig.gva.es/index.php?id=gvsig&amp;L=2">gvSIG</a> and see the feature. Just for grins, I then deleted the feature in gvSIG and refreshed my ArcMap display to see it disappear.</p>

<p>As you can see from the screen capture, I am using ArcEditor but that is because of other ArcGIS-related work that I do. zigGIS doesn&#8217;t care about the license tier you use and will work just fine with ArcView.</p>

<p>ArcGIS Desktop 9.3 does have some improved mapping tools so those of you who have been using zigGIS as a lightweight means of access your PostGIS data from ArcMap can now look at what 9.3 has to offer.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Well, 9.3 is now shipping so the sun is setting on my time with the release candidate. One update from my first post: I posted the problem I was having with sdelayer -o register not calculate a default extent on the Beta forum and I got a reply that it shouldn&#8217;t work that way and they would look at it. I&#8217;ll probably see shortly whether a fix made it in this time or if I have to wait for a service pack.</p>

<p>The last piece I wanted to cover was working with the layer that I loaded in from a shapefile using ArcCatalog. As I indicated before, I used the PG_GEOMETRY keyword to force the use of PostGIS geometry.</p>

<p>I first left the layer as a simple feature. Within ArcGIS everything behaved as would be expected. I could note no difference in behavior versus what I would expect dealing with any other ArcSDE layer. I was also able to add the layer into uDig, but with a little anomalous behavior.</p>

<p>The layer I was working with was a polygon layer. When I loaded the layer into uDig, it displayed as a polygon layer but the uDig TOC showed a line symbol:</p>

<p><a href="http://geobabble.files.wordpress.com/2008/07/udig_arcsde_layer.png"><img alt="ArcSDE PostgreSQL layers in uDig" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-205" height="218" src="http://geobabble.files.wordpress.com/2008/07/udig_arcsde_layer.png?w=300" width="300" /></a></p>

<p>Additionally, the fema_regions layer was not editable in uDig. The other layer editable but had the same display issues. To be fair, I had similar behavior with some layers I had loaded into PostGIS from shapefiles using FWTools. In that case, it didn&#8217;t happen with all of the layers I loaded. In this case, I have not experimented with enough data sets to determine if the behavior is consistent or intermittent. I would also need to test whether it&#8217;s the loader, PostGIS or uDig. Time has not been a friend here.</p>

<p>Next, I did some experimentation with versioning. I versioned my milbases layer, created a test version, added a feature and save the edit. As expected, when I connected in uDig, it connected to the DEFAULT version and I did not see my edit. Since this layer was editable in uDig, I added a feature here and refreshed my ArcMap display. In this case, I was able to see the uDig-created feature (in DEFAULT) in both versions (again, as expected).</p>

<p>My previous posts have brought a few questions about raster catalogs and the like. I have been able to load raster data and create raster catalogs. This is not, however, raster data in PostGIS. This is ArcSDE raster data next to PostGIS. PostGIS has no idea the raster data is there (although the raster footprints display in uDig as rectangles).</p>

<p>So, depending on how you implement it, ArcSDE for PostgreSQL can provide interoperability between ArcGIS and an open-source stack. uDig can be leveraged in a pinch to edit data loaded into ArcSDE using the PostGIS geometry type, allowing you to expand to meet demand. Additionally, ESRI has implemented the full geodatabase capability within PostgreSQL, providing a great alternative to shops that was GIS but not necessarily Oracle/DB2/SQL Server.</p>

<p>In future posts, I examine different technology mixes that can be used to build some compelling hybrid stacks.</p>

<p>Now, where&#8217;s my 9.3 shipment?</p>
